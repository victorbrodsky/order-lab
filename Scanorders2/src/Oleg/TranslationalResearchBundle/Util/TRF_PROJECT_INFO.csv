Altered stroma microenvironment is a common feature of many tumors.  There is increasing evidence that these stromal changes, including increased proteases and cytokines, may promote tumor progression. For example, stromal fibroblasts commonly become 'activated' myofibroblasts, expressing SMA and secreting cytokines, proteases, and matrix proteins. 
Mast cells produce fibrogenic cytokines, including PDGF, TGFb, and bFGF. Immunohistochemical studies show close correlation between mast cell expression of bFGF and reticulin fibrosis in mastocytosis.  In addition, TGFb receptor I (RI)-negative cases of mastocytosis are prognostically less favorable than positive cases. This finding may be related to the fact that the TGFbR complex functions as a tumor suppressor gene.  
Vascular endothelial changes are also important in tumor growth and abnormal stem cell mobilization. The latter, a common occurrence in CIMF, is associated with alteration of marrow stroma/vascularity and central to the production of extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH). Splenomegaly seems to be reduced by anti- JAK2 treatment. No information is available concerning marrow responses.  With the advent of JAK2 inhibitors treatment, a careful evaluation of posttreatment BM biopsies will become necessary to assess stromal response in relation to disease manifestation.

Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs) are Epstein Barr virus (EBV) associated B cell lymphoid proliferations.  The patients who develop these lesions have an unpredictable clinical course and outcome with some patients having lesions that regress following a reduction in immunosuppression and others who despite aggressive theraputic intervention have progressive disease leading to their demise.  We have previously shown the PTLDs in solid organ (SOT) recipients can be classified into 3 clinicopathologic categories based on primarily morphology and molecular genetic composition; although the early lesion (plasmacytic hyperplasias ¿¿ non-aggressive; often regress) and the lymphomas/myeloma (aggressive; do not regress) categories correlate well with outcome, the polymorphic lesions (the most common category) still often exhibit unpredictable clinical behavior.
It has been shown that the composition of the associated inflammatory infiltrate in B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (such as in follicular lymphoma) can correlate with prognosis.  The polymorphic PTLDs as the name implies are polymorphic proliferations composed of the EBV positive B cells and a mixture of inflammatory cells in different compositions.  However, an extensive immunophenotypic analysis of these lesions, in comparison to the early lesions and the lymphoma/myeloma or in comparison to clinical course and outcome has not been undertaken.

NC Panarelli, RK Yantiss, Y-T Chen
CDH17 is a member of the cadherin superfamily with expression in normal intestinal epithelium and fetal hepatocytes. CDX2 is thought to regulate the transcription of CDH17 in human colonocytes.  In this study, we compared the expression of CDH17 to that of CDX2 in carcinomas and normal tissues from the esophagus, stomach, colon, pancreas, and liver using tissue microarrays of non-neoplastic and tumor tissues from 47 cases of esophageal adenocarcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, diffuse-type and intestinal-type gastric carcinoma, colonic adenocarcinoma, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Immunohistochemical stains for CDH17 and CDX2 were performed; positivity was defined as membranous staining for CDH17 and nuclear staining for CDX2.  Our initial results showed co-expression of CDH17 and CDX2 is uniformly present in colonic adenocarcinomas, and is common in esophageal and gastric adenocarcinomas. Thus, CDH17 may be used in conjunction with CDX2 to confirm intestinal differentiation among adenocarcinomas. Importantly, most pancreatic adenocarcinomas express CDH17, but not CDX2, indicating that isolated CDH17 expression may be useful in identifying carcinomas of the pancreas.  One case of hepatocellular carcinoma showed focal CDH17 staining; none of the cases showed staining for CDX2.  Based on these findings, we would like to further evaluate the utility of CDH17 as a diagnostic marker of gastrointestinal malignancies, particularly in metastatic disease.  Our aims are:
1.Evaluate CDH17 expression in cases of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma and in a larger number of cases of primary hepatocelular carcinoma.
2.We also plan to compare CDH17 expression with CDX2 expression in adenocarcinomas of the breast, ovary, and endometrium in order to evaluate possible CDH17 expression in carcinomas outside of the gastrointestinal tract.
For Aim 1:  We will identify 20-30 cases of metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma from our archived material and perform immunohistochemical stains for CDH17 and CDX2 on paraffin sections.

Previous studies have shown that patients with autoimmune pancreatitis have increased numbers of IgG4 positive plasma cells in their pancreata, as well as elevated IgG4 serologic titers.  In addition, regulatory T cells, which express FOXP3, are reportedly abnormal in patients with immune-mediated disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and other entities.  We propose the current study to determine whether IgG4 and/or FOXP3 positive cells in the ampulla reflect the presence of autoimmune pancreatitis compared to its mimics.

This decreases the chance that implantation failure occurred due to a chromosomal problem, relying more on a possible role of implantation failure due to a p53 or MDM2 variant.  

Donor egg recipients are required to undergo a “prep cycle” prior to embryo transfer. A prep cycle entails hormonal preparation of the uterine lining to mimic a natural cycle followed by an endometrial biopsy of the uterine lining.  The biopsy results are used to see if standard hormonal preparation is adequate to prepare the uterine lining for an embryo transfer.

Neo-angiogenesis promotes tumor growth and metastasis while lymphangiogenesis supports tumor invasion and metastasis. As signaling molecules regulating these two processes are driven by three different tyrosine kinase receptors, namely VEGFR1 (Flt-1), VEGFR2 (KDR) and VEGFR3 (Flt-4), we propose to assess the expression pattern of these receptors and their cognate ligands including VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D and PlGF, during neoadjuvant therapy with anti-angiogenic agents such as Cox-2 inhibitors. Since Cox-2 inhibition blocks the activity of VEGF-A, but not VEGF-C,VEGF-D, PlGF or VEGF-B, these studies will provide important information to determine whether inhibition of VEGF-A/VEGFR2 signaling pathway alone is sufficient to block tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in lung/esophageal cancers.

Mucinous adenocarcinoma of the endometrium is an uncommon type of endometrial cancer accounting for less than 10% of endometrial cancers. A single study of 18 cases of MUC-AD was published previously [Melhem 1987]. The characteristics of patients with MUC-AD were similar to those of patients with typical endometrioid adenocarcinoma and similar prognosis was observed.  
Hellweg et al. [1995] described six cases of MUC-AD following tamoxifen treatment and eleven cases arising after gestagen therapy.  The authors hypothesized that tamoxifen and gestagens were responsible for the development of mucinous metaplasia of the endometrium and progression to malignancy.  

Goals: 
The first goal is to evaluate epidemiological factors associated with development of MUC-AD; and specifically if there is an increased incidence of mucinous type endometrial carcinoma in women treated with progestins, tamoxifen, hormone replacement therapy, or following a long-term oral contraceptive regimen. 
The second goal is to assess patients’ prognosis relatively to the patients with typical endometrioid adenocarcinoma.

Methods:
Chart review of patients with MUC-AD from 1996 to 2008. The following clinico-pathologic data will be extracted and compared to a matched control group:

Several in vitro observations suggest that vFLIP, a protein expressed during latency, is an important viral oncogene. It is essential for the survival of KSHV-infected PEL cells, mainly by constitutively activating the NF-&#954;B pathway. In order to assess the role of vFLIP in the pathogenesis of PEL, we developed transgenic mouse models expressing vFLIP in B-cells, by using the ROSA26 knock-in system. A specifically restricted expression of the transgene in CD19+ B-cells has been achieved by crossing the ROSA26.vFLIP knock-in mice with other mice expressing cre recombinase under the control of the CD19 promoter. These mice have also been crossed with the LANA transgenic mice to assess a potential synergistic effect between these two KSHV latent proteins in the lymphomagenic process of PEL.

The impact of vFLIP expression in B-cell development and lymphomagenesis in these mice is currently being studied by using molecular and flow cytometric analysis. Also, detailed microscopic analysis will be performed on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded specimens obtained from all organs, with particular attention on hematopoietic and lymphoid organs (bone marrow, spleen, lymph nodes, thymus), stained with hematoxillin and eosin, and with different markers involved in B-cell differentiation and proliferation.

Preliminary results indicate that, by constitutively activating the NF-&#954;B pathway in pre-germinal center B-cells expressing CD19, the normal B-cell differentiation is impaired, and provide clues about possible aberrant differentiation in PEL cells.",5,"rop9028","Admin Approved - RK - 07/25/2008

Background: Recurrent fusions involving ETS family transcription factors ERG, ETV1, ETV4 or ETV5 have been identified in the majority of prostate cancers. Fusion of the 3’ end of ERG and the 5’-untranslated region of the androgen-regulated gene TMPRSS2 leads to the over-expression of an androgen-responsive product. This event has been shown by several studies to be associated with poor clinical outcomes, higher tumor stage, higher Gleason scores, presence of metastatic disease, and specific morphologic features. So far 27 ETS family members and over 200 ETS target genes have been identified.

Objective: To identify ETS fusion PCa related biomarkers which can help to better differentiate between lethal and indolent prostate cancer. 

Material and Methodology: The project would include constructing tissue micro arrays (TMAs) consisting of up to 200 tumor samples and having slides cut (~100)  for molecular analysis, like fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC).

This amplification is commonly followed by gene rearrangement, in which there is a deletion of amino acids 6 – 273, producing the variant EGFRvIII. The mutated protein is ligand independent and constitutively active at the cell membrane increasing cell proliferation and decreasing cell death. 
As well as the EGFR gene, the tumor suppressor, PTEN, is often lost in patients with glioblastoma. Since PTEN is known to be an inhibitor of the proliferation of malignant gliomas, the combination of EGFRvIII and the loss of PTEN have a very poor prognosis in patients with these two mutations.
Erlotinib (Tarceva) is an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits the EGFR signaling pathway inside the cell. Recent studies have shown that having EGFRvIII coupled with PTEN expression may result in a better response to Erlotinib.  Erlotinib therefore provides an opportunity for testing as therapy for gliobastoma. 
We hypothesize that patients with EGFRvIII expression and PTEN expression will have an enhanced response to treatment with Erlotinib in this Phase I/II study.  Demographic information about the patients in this single arm study will be gathered and all human tissue will be processed for PTEN expression and the EGFRvIII mutation.

effects on both Th1 and Th2 cells and attenuate the proinflammatory

downregulate autoimmune disease. Likewise, B-cell deficiency delays 
the emergence of regulatory T cells and IL-10 production in the

exacerbate disease in some autoimmune conditions, possibly reflecting

Diagnosis is often delayed, as invasive testing in the form of diagnostic laparoscopy is required for definitive diagnosis.  Recent research has introduced the possibility of diagnosing endometriosis through endometrial curettage/endometrial biopsy alone1. Researchers previously reported the finding of small unmyelinated sensory C nerve fibers in the functional layer of endometrium in women with endometriosis.  While results of the associated pilot study appear promising, a larger scale study has not yet been accomplished. Here at Weill-Cornell, we have access to one of the largest infertility clinics in the world. Using our extensive database of endometrial specimens taken from women who have undergone a diagnostic hysteroscopy/laparoscopy for pelvic pain or infertility and have received a diagnosis of endometriosis, we hope to collect a substantial amount of data to significantly test this theory. The pathology database would be searched for endometrial curettage specimens taken from women who have undergone laparoscopy for pelvic pain or infertility which yielded a diagnosis of endometriosis via a peritoneal biopsy.  A control group of endometrial specimens representing women who had undergone a laparoscopy pelvic pain/infertility without diagnosis of endometriosis would also be selected.

Jones, M.D.","212-746-6328","joj2013@med.cornell.edu",0,,"Recent studies have suggested that the metastatic potential of a primary
tumor can be encoded early in the development of the tumor and throughout
the bulk of the tumor.  Tumor progression leads to the development of
microenvironments which elicit transient gene expression patterns that
support invasion and intravasation. This model is referred to as the tumor
microenvironment of metastasis, or TMEM.  Among the genes implicated in
increased metastatic potential are a number involved in cell protrusion and
motility.  Mena is a key motility protein that is upregulated in invasive
tumors, and several Mena isoforms have been identified.  In vitro studies
and animal models have suggested that each of these isoforms confers a
particular (increased or decreased) ability for tumor cells to move and
ultimately metastasize.  We propose to evaluate expression of these Mena
isoforms in human tissue (via immunohistochemistry) to assess whether
particular Mena isoforms might be a predictor of poor outcome/metastasis in
breast cancer patients.
Our previous work evaluating the tumor microenvironment has gathered
material from sixty patients with primary ductal carcinoma of the breast.
Thirty of these patients have systemic metastases, while the other thirty
patients do not.  The metastatic and non-metastatic patients are paired so
that all current prognostic criteria are equivalent.  In order to more
rapidly and efficiently assess possible biomarkers that may predict
metastasis, including Mena, we propose to create a tissue microarray using
the patient material we have previously gathered.
We would also like to extend the work we've done on breast cancer to
a breast cancer TMA platform, as well as looking for the presence of
TMEM in other malignancies including prostate, lung, and skin
(melanoma).  Our approach to date has been a triple immunostain in
which TMEM is defined as a microanatomic compartment, composed of a
CD31+endothelial cell, a CD68+ macrophage, and a mena-expressing
tumor cell in direct apposition.  Collaborators at Yale have offered
anonymized breast cancer TMA slides for us to
evaluate.  Simultaneously they will be trying to develop a triple
stain that is amenable to the AQUA system.
For work on other malignancies, we may require initial evaluations on
full sections, but with the intent to moving to a TMA platform as

PGE2 induces aromatase expression, leading to increased production of estrogen, which potentiates breast carcinogenesis.  Hence, the ability of NSAIDs to preferentially protect against HR-positive breast cancer may be explained by a reduction in PG-mediated induction of aromatase activity. Given this background, it is important to determine whether other enzymes involved in PG synthesis are deregulated in breast cancer.  Both mPGES-1 (microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1) and cPGES (cytosolic prostaglandin E synthase) have been reported to convert cyclooxygenase-derived PGH2 to PGE2.  Our laboratory has shown that estradiol can induce both mPGES-1 and cPGES in vitro.  Hence, we postulate that levels of these two enzymes may be higher in HR-positive compared to HR-negative human breast cancers.  Immunohistochemical methods have been developed in collaboration with the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine for both mPGES-1 and cPGES.  To determine whether amounts of mPGES-1 and cPGES are differentially expressed in HR-positive vs. HR-negative breast cancers, we would like to develop a tissue microarray (TMA) of human breast cancers, in which the cases are organized to reflect hormone receptor status.  In addition to HR status, other factors (i.e. HER-2/neu status and tumor stage) may also impact the levels of mPGES-1 and cPGES.  Hence, it would be useful if other clinical and pathologic characteristics of the tumors were known.",5,"ryantiss","Admin Approved - RK - 08/26/08",1,19-AUG-08,"The power analysis performed by the biostatistics group has assessed the needed sample size per group for testing the equality of two proportions p1 and p2 with 90% power at 0.05 significance level using a two-sided test.

Therapeutic modalities such as rituximab, trastuzumab, and bevacizumab are frequently employed in the treatment of cancer.  Although antibodies that target tumor or vascular antigens may be useful in an unconjugated form, it may be advantageous to couple an antibody to a cytotoxic compound.  This strategy allows for the selective delivery of cytotoxic agents to the tumor with the goal of reducing the toxicity compared with the systemic administration of cytotoxic agents.  The development of the antibody drug conjugate CR011-vcMMAE, which targets tumor cells via their cell surface overexpression of GPNMB, is based on such a rationale.The study drug, 

CR011-vcMMAE is a recombinant fully-human monoclonal antibody (CR011), conjugated to the cytotoxic agent monomethylauristatin E (MMAE) via the protease-sensitive peptide valine-citruline (vc) linker.  The CR011 antibody was generated against glycoprotein NMB (GPNMB), a transmembrane protein which is highly expressed in tumor cells.  Overexpression of GPNMB induces invasion and metastases, suggesting a role in progression of cancer.  The normal function of GPNMB is poorly understood, although it is hypothesized that it plays a role in tumor invasion and metastasis.",5,"solidtumor","Admin Approved - RK - 08/14/08",1,13-AUG-08,"Pathology fees will be reimbursed by the Division of Hematology/Medical Oncology.",0,,"","","",,"",,,,,,""

Although the association between KSHV and EBV with lymphoproliferative disorders is well documented, little is known about the natural history of these diseases, specially in patients with HIV. Lymphoid tissues of HIV-infected patients show cellular and architectural changes that range from lymphoid hyperplasia to severe lymphoid depletion. Co-infection by KSHV or EBV in this scenario might be a risk factor for the development of virus-associated lymphoma. Brazil have some endemic areas for KSHV infection, and 38/92 (41.3%) lymph nodes from deceased Brazilian patients with HIV-associated benign lymphadenopaty (HBL) evaluated retrospectively were positive for KSHV by PCR. In contrast, 13/71 (18.3%) tonsils with follicular lymphoid reactive hyperplasia (FLRH) from HIV-negative patients were KSHV-positive. The aim of this study is to validate those results and evaluate these cases further, using a panel of immunohistochemistry (IHC) markers to identify and characterize the KSHV-infected cells. Tissue sections will be stained with antibodies against KSHV LANA-1, vIL6, ORF59 and K8.1 proteins.

As results cannot be anticipated, an accurate estimation of the number of additional IHC DSs to be performed cannot be provided. However, if all 6 cases (3 HBL and 3 FBL) show KSHV-positive B cells, the total number of DSs expected for immunophenotyping of KSHV-infected cells are 60 (IHC stains for 10 markers in addition to one KSHV protein).

Our primary goal is to determine whether expression levels of steroid hormones and steroid-hormone co-activators in bladder cancer cystectomy patients correlate with standard clinicopathologic parameters and post-operative disease status. Our preliminary findings in 45 bladder cancer patients reveal downregulation of the androgen receptor and of steroid-hormone co-activators, LSD1 and JMJ2DA, in bladder cancer tissue relative to normal bladder tissue; the opposite relation is suggested for the estrogen receptor-beta.  While the data also suggest a correlation between expression level decrease (or increase) and pathologic tumor stage, the current sample size is underpowered.  We are therefore requesting slides (from formalin-fixed parafin embedded tissue blocks) from an additional 25 patients at this time for each of the four proteins (AR, ER-beta, LSD1, JMJ2DA), to give a total of 10 cases/T-stage (pTa, pT1, pTis, pT2, pT3, pT4) per marker, and 15 cases for normal bladder (pT0) per marker.

Pathologically, idiopathic myelofibrosis is featured by progressive accumulation of connective tissue in concert with marked angiogenesis (growth of new blood vessels) of the bone marrow.  Both fibrogenesis and angiogenesis are considered to develop consequent to the intramedullary (inside the bone) release of various growth-promoting factors from proliferating and dysplastic bone marrow cells.

In spite of their often insidious clinical onset, each of the MPD has the potential to undergo clonal evolution and a stepwise progression that terminates in bone marrow failure due to myelofibrosis, ineffective hematopoiesis or in transformation to acute leukemia. Recently it has been learned that a point mutation in the tyrosine kinase, Jak2, accounts for the characteristic growth factor hypersensitivity observed in MPD, however, the molecular mechanisms that result in the etiology and progression of these disorders have not been fully characterized. Because of the long evolution of these disorders, identifying biomarkers of disease progression and the development of molecularly targeted translational therapies has been difficult.

In addition, the differential expression of basal tubulin acetylation in prostate cancer cell lines has been shown to correlate with prostate cancer progression. To address the role of tubulin acetylation in clinical response to treatment with taxanes we conducted a single institution pilot retrospective analysis on pts with castrate-resistant PC who received chemotherapy with Docetaxel who had archival paraffin-embedded tissue available for immunohistochemical analysis of acetylated tubulin (AcTub). Levels of AcTub were scored from 0-4 based on percent positive PC cells present, and then correlated with clinical response, according to the modified PSA Working Group Criteria. Our results showed that increased levels of AcTub predicted a shorter time to progression in PC patients treated with docetaxel. To determine whether tubulin acetylation can be used as a prognostic biomarker for PC patients we propose to immunostain two PC TMAs (Tissue Microarrays)with AcTub mAb.

Approximately 40% and 10-15% of colorectal carcinomas harbor detectable KRAS and BRAF mutations, respectively; and mutational status is an important predictor of therapy response and outcome.  Unfortunately, the heterogeneous nature of colon cancer (i.e. patient age, environmental agents, microsatellite instability, tumor location, and morphology) has impaired comprehensive analysis of the relationships between KRAS and BRAF mutational status and other molecular changes.  Therefore, analysis of a clinically and pathologically homogeneous group of tumors known to harbor abnormalities in RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling may elucidate the complex interrelationships between KRAS, BRAF, and other molecules important to neoplastic progression.

Low-grade mucinous neoplasms represent a homogeneous group of gastrointestinal tumors that may give rise to pseudomyxoma peritonei in some cases.  They develop exclusively in the appendix of middle-aged and older adults, show a predilection for women and a consistent pattern of dissemination, and display low-grade morphologic features.  Importantly, these tumors harbor KRAS mutations at rates comparable to those of colorectal cancer.  By focusing on a well-defined, homogeneous subgroup of neoplasms of the lower gastrointestinal tract, we hope to gain insight into the potential associations between KRAS, BRAF, and other cellular pathways in more common gastrointestinal tumors.

More than 80 genes with such expression characteristics have been defined, more than 30 of them by the work of our laboratory; one of them, NY-ESO-1, is now in multiple phase I/II cancer vaccine trials.  For any new CT antigen to become a suitable immunotherapeutic target, this antigen needs to have confirmed protein expression in at least one or two major types of human cancer with a significant frequency of expression.  To pursue this, our laboratory has produced or obtained antibodies specific for more than 20 new CT antigens, including GAGE, CT45, PASD1, NXF2, SAGE1, CXorf61 etc.  Using these antibodies, we intend to analyze the expression of these CT antigens in major human tumor types by immunohistochemical analysis.  The tumor types to be analyzed will include, but not limited to, tumors of the lung, breast, gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract, head and neck, skin and soft tissue etc.  Paraffin-embedded tumor material and corresponding normal tissues will be obtained from the Dept of Pathology and tissue microarrays will be constructed by the TMA facility. Individual unstained slides will also be analyzed for selected cases. The immunohistochemical analysis will be performed in the PI’s laboratory.

It has a predilection for adults in the third to fourth decades of life. The early descriptions emphasize an aggressive clinical  course.  There is a slight female predominance, but in our experience the more rapidly progressive and ultimately fatal cases occur more often in men (unpublished observations). In the revised WHO-EORTC classification, the term subcutaneous T cell lymphoma has been supplanted by subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma and refers largely to the alpha beta variant.  

There is an overlap with enigmatic conditions such as lupus profundus, atypical lymphocytic lobular panniculitis, Weber-Christian Disease and histiocytic cytophagic panniculitis. Some cases of panniculitis-like T cell lymphoma have sufficient clinical and morphologic overlap with lupus profundus that they are initially diagnosed as the latter entity.  The diagnosis of lupus profundus becomes questionable in such cases where there is lack of responsiveness to traditional therapies such as Plaquenil. In our own experience constitutional symptoms are uncommon in most cases of lupus profundus and atypical lymphocytic lobular panniculitis and should be an important clinical clue to a diagnosis of panniculitis-like T cell lymphoma.   Although it is usually seen in adults, panniculitis-like T cell lymphoma is described in children and there are reports of what we believe to be a precursor lesion, atypical lymphocytic lobular panniculitis, in children as young as 6 years.  We have seen panniculitis like T cell lymphoma in children as young as 4 years of age.
 
One of the striking aspects of Panniculitis-like T cell lymphoma is its predilection to involve the fat and its tendency for subcutaneous localization despite significant systemic sequelae including hemophagocytic syndrome. An additional curious aspect of this lymphoma is an apparent tendency for the neoplastic cells to proliferate within the adipocytes which from a morphologic perspective corresponds to so called rimming of the adipocyte.  


The importance in recognizing this potential growth dependency between CCL3 positive neoplastic T cells and their potential tropism to the CCR5 expressing adipocytes has significant therapeutic implications. There is an FDA approved antibody which targets CCR5.

We would like to explore the following hypothesis: adipocytes in panniculitis like T cell lymphoma express CCR5 while the neoplastic T cells exhibit expression  of CCL3.",10,"hhp2001","Admin Approved - RK - 10/20/2008",1,17-OCT-08,"The Dermatopathology division has purchased the two antibodies CCR5 and CCL3 using funds from the division.

For example, common categories include diffuse large B cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma, but there are also frequent Burkitt-like lymphomas with features of both for which treatment decisions are difficult. Furthermore, a subset of both categories is associated with infection by EBV, adding further heterogeneity. Our goal is to do the largest study to date that includes gene expression profiling (by DASL), profiling of microRNA expression (Agilent arrays done in Cornell Ithaca) analysis for mutation of selected genes, and correlation with immunophenotypic classification of TMAs done on these cases (CD3, CD20, CD10, BCL-2, Mum-1, Ki67, KSHV LANA). In these TMAs, ISH will also be done to determine the presence of EBV and relevant translocations (cMyc, BCL2 and BCL6). A specific focus will be analysis of NF-kB signatures, and determination of whether cases with activated NF-kB have viral infection and or mutations in relevant genes (CARD11, A20, TRAF2), which have been found to have molecular alterations in B cell lymphomas.

Given the different treatment strategies between benign and malignant nodules, as well as the inherent morbidity associated with surgery, better pre-operative determination of benign versus malignant nodules is a principal goal. An accurate method for excluding malignancy and for characterizing tumor behavior might allow for less aggressive resection (i.e. hemi- vs. total thyroidectomy) for tumors of lower invasive potential or the avoidance of surgery altogether in cases clearly deemed to be benign. Given inherent limitations of cytological evaluation of FNA, attention has turned towards molecular identification of malignant lesions to enhance the cytopathologic diagnosis of thyroid nodules. 

This study proposes to investigate molecular profiles of thyroid tumors. Our aim is to determine if a singular gene or a panel of genes can serve as distinguishing signatures for tumor aggressiveness and malignancy. This data could lead to tailored treatment strategies including surgical approach and adjuvant therapies.

Several in vitro observations suggest that vFLIP, a protein expressed during latency, is an important viral oncogene. It is essential for the survival of KSHV-infected PEL cells, mainly by constitutively activating the NF-&#954;B pathway. In order to assess the role of vFLIP in the pathogenesis of PEL, we developed transgenic mouse models expressing vFLIP in B-cells, by using the ROSA26 knock-in system. A specifically restricted expression of the transgene in CD19+ B-cells has been achieved by crossing the ROSA26.vFLIP knock-in mice with other mice expressing cre recombinase under the control of the CD19 promoter. These mice have also been crossed with the LANA transgenic mice to assess a potential synergistic effect between these two KSHV latent proteins in the lymphomagenic process of PEL.
The impact of vFLIP expression in B-cell development and lymphomagenesis in these mice is currently being studied by using molecular and flow cytometric analysis. Also, detailed microscopic analysis will be performed on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded specimens obtained from all organs, with particular attention on hematopoietic and lymphoid organs (bone marrow, spleen, lymph nodes, thymus), stained with hematoxillin and eosin, and with different markers involved in B-cell differentiation and proliferation.

Dicer, an RNase III enzyme, is required for processing and activation of miRNAs.   Multiple studies indicated an association between expression of Dicer and tumor progression in ovarian, prostate and lung cancers. Additionally, it is thought that Dicers may be negatively regulated via a feedback look by the activated miRNAs such as let-7.  As yet, these relationships have not been examined in PTC.  Our preliminary microarray analysis of PTC with gross vs. no extrathyroidal extension(ETE) revealed down-regulation of Dicer1 in tumors with gross extension.

However, in most individuals the virus persists and the lifelong chronic infection is free of complications due to effective immune control indicating that the virus normally establishes a finely balanced and economical relationship with its host. No animal model exists for EBV preventing scientists to assign protective functions to different immune compartments such as CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. We have developed a mouse system to address some of these question in vivo. Based on a recent publication describing the development of a human immune system upon injection of human stem cells in NOD/Scid/&#947;cnull mice, we were able to generate mice with human immune components including human B cells, T cells, NK cells, and dendritic cells. We were able to show that these mice develop human EBV-specific T cell responses and that these EBV-specific T cells have a major contribution to the immune control of the viral infection. Notably, upon T cell depletion mice develop an EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disease that is similar to the disease observed in immunocompromised patients. In collaboration with Drs. Amy Chadburn we were able to analyze for the first time latency patterns of EBV in vivo in these humanized mice.

Systemic Sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that causes an excess of collagen and other proteins to accumulate, resulting in the tightening and hardening of the skin. In vitro-studies have suggested that Gleevec may inhibit collagen and extracellular matrix production by scleroderma fibroblasts. In addition, Gleevec has been both well tolerated by animals and an effective inhibitor of fibrosis in in-vivo animal models of fibrosis.
The primary objective of this study will be to determine the safety and tolerability of Gleevec in patients with systemic sclerosis, but important secondary outcomes of relevance will be improvement in disease status as defined by skin scores and indices of pulmonary function. Clinical assessment of the degree of skin thickening is the principal method used to determine the progression of disease activity in systemic sclerosis patients. The Modified Rodnan Skin Score is the most widely used method to determine skin thickness. It is a technique in which the degree of skin thickening is assessed in 17 specific body areas by simple clinical palpitation. While this method has proven to be reliable and valid among multiple investigators, it's nevertheless a subjective way of evaluating patients in clinical trials. Thus biopsy specimens can be weighed to confirm the Modified Rodnan Skin Score.
Skin biopsies (4mm punch biopsies) from the distal forearm will be done prior to initiation of treatment with imatinib mesylate and after 12 months of treatment. The primary purpose of the study is to determine whether imatinib mesylate is safe and tolerable in patients with Systemic Sclerosis. However, a secondary purpose of the trial is to assess the efficacy of imatinib. We will do this by assessing histological change and evaluating change in various biomarkers in the skin. Additionally, we will validate the Modified Rodnan Skin Score's ability to assess skin thickness and changes in skin thickness.
Twenty five of thirty before/after pairs of 4mm punch biopsy will be cut in half at the time of the procedure. One half of the sample will be fixed in formalin for processing by the WCMC Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine. It is requested that the specimens at WCMC be paraffin-embedded and stained by H & E, Alpha-SMA staining (for the presence of myofibroblasts), elastin stain, trichrome stain, and Gomori silver stain. Additional tissue in block will be saved and later assessed by immunohistochemical staining for erk, p-Erk, (p)c-abl, (p)TGF/Beta/Alpha, (p) PDGF/Beta/Alpha, IL-1, IL-6, MCP, pro-collagen 1, egr-1, COMP and other cytokine stains. The other half of the sample will be submitted to the Hospital for Special Surgery for processing in the research laboratory. RNA will be extracted from the skin and tested for gene expression by real-time quantitative PCR for all the above proteins and additional proteins including extracellular matrix proteins, cytokines, cell-signaling proteins, and other proteins involved in fibrosis and inflammation. The Department of Pathology will bill the investigator for the technical services to embed, fix, process, cut and stain tissue. The tissue will be submitted according to the instructions for research only specimens.
Ten of the 60 skin biopsy specimens will be submitted in total for RNA isolation. After RNA isolation, the RNA will be stored at -80 C.

The dermal form of BMT is a lesion manifesting worrisome architectural features with cytologic atypia exceeding that encountered in banal nevi. 

When confronted with the borderline tumor our treatment approach has been one of wide excision and completion lymphadenectomy however the approach to the borderline melanocytic tumor remains  controversial. The utilization of molecular techniques such as comparative genomic hybridization(CGH) and fluorescent in situ hybridization(FISH)  in the assessment of   the borderline melanocytic tumor has not been widely used from a diagnostic perspective largely because of a lack of such technology in most laboratories mn.  In one study employing the technique of CGH DNA copy number changes were noted between  benign nevi and melanomas.

Background information

The protein tyrosine kinase SYK is a key mediator of B-cell receptor signaling. Recent studies have shown that it is constitutively active in several common B cell malignancies, including follicular lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, CLL and mantle cell lymphoma. Recently, it was reported that fostamatinib, a SYK inhibitor, showed a significant clinical activity in DLBCL and CLL patients in a phase II clinical trial.  Through the study of SRC, an upstream kinase, our group has found that SYK kinase can be activated independent of SRC, suggesting alternative mechanisms or alternative pathways leading to overexpression or constitutive activation of SYK that contributes to lymphomagenesis.

Research Plans

The expression of SYK was mostly studied using Western blots in cell lines of individual types of lymphoma.  We propose immunohistochemical studies for total SYK and the phosphorylated forms (active) of SYK in tissues of various types of lymphomas using tissue microarray.  This systemic approach would allow us to compare the relative expression and activation of SYK among several different types of lymphoma.  This study is part of our project that focuses on the role of SYK in the pathogenesis of lymphoid malignancies.  Besides the TMA study, we plan to investigate in my own laboratory, in different types of lymphoma, 1) the mechanisms that lead to SYK dysregulation, 2) the downstream signaling events of SYK, 3) the effects of SYK inhibition in lymphoma survival and proliferation.  In addition, we plan to establish a SYK transgenic mouse model.  The proposed TMA study will provide useful preliminary results for a grant application.

Experimental preparations completed

Antibodies against SYK and phosphorylated SYK are commercially available but have not been used for IHC analyses.  We have already identified by Western blots several cell lines that express or lack SYK. Through the Pathology Core, we would like to construct cell blocks using these cell lines to test and optimized IHC conditions before the assay is applied to lymphoma TMA.

However, approximately 25% of sporadic colonic carcinomas, almost all of which arise in the proximal colon, harbor BRAF mutations, often in combination with DNA hypermethylation at CpG islands, MSI-H, and preservation of APC/B-catenin/Wnt signaling.  Given that BRAF mutations and the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) are only present in 1-2% of conventional adenomas, it is likely that BRAF-mutated/CIMP-high/MSI-H colorectal adenocarcinomas are derived from a different type of precursor lesion.  Currently, there is great interest in identifying such a precursor, since it would help identify patients who are at risk for cancer development.
Some investigators have proposed that BRAF-mutated/CIMP-high/MSI-H colonic adenocarcinomas develop from a “non-adenomatous” precursor, namely, the non-dysplastic serrated polyp (i.e. sessile serrated adenoma, sessile serrated polyp).  In fact, this widespread belief has led clinicians to treat these lesions similar to adenomas with close clinical surveillance and even surgical resection in some cases.  Unfortunately, the molecular, morphologic, and endoscopic features of these putatively premalignant polyps overlap substantially with those of hyperplastic polyps, which are extremely common and clinically inconsequential in the vast majority of cases.  Furthermore, the overall risk of progression to dysplasia and/or carcinoma is extremely low among these lesions.  
As an alternative hypothesis, we propose that conventional adenomas from the proximal colon, either with or without co-existing serrated polyps, might be the precursors of the BRAF mutated/CIMP-high/MSI-H cancers, and that these adenomas may show molecular features of the “serrated neoplastic pathway”, rather than APC/B-catenin/Wnt signaling abnormalities. As the first step to test this hypothesis, we have identified 25 patients who have both sessile serrated polyps and tubular adenomas of the proximal colon.  We would like to evaluate the adenomas from this small series of cases for the presence of BRAF mutations and CpG island methylation, and compare the prevalence of these changes to that reported in the literature (1-2%).   Assessment for CIMP would be performed by Dr. Wade Samowitz, of ARUP Laboratories, who will be sent unstained tissue sections for evaluation.  Based on the results of these preliminary studies, we may subsequently evaluate the molecular features of proximal colonic adenomas occurring in patients without serrated polyps, in order to determine whether BRAF-mutations and CIMP-high are specifically seen in adenomas that develop in patients with serrated neoplasia (i.e. a field effect), or if these molecular features are typical of adenomas of the proximal colon compared to left-sided lesions.",5,"ryantiss","Admin Approved - RK - 07/10/2009",1,09-JUL-09,"Initial analysis will be limited to BRAF mutation assessment of 25 adenomas:

However, we have had eight recent cases of neoadjuvantly treated rectal carcinomas that show complete loss of DNA repair protein expression by immunohistochemistry, despite the presence of microsatellite stability by molecular testing. This issue may have serious clinical implications, since DNA MMR protein evaluation is generally performed on resection specimens, rather than biopsy material, and most patients who meet Bethesda criteria for DNA MMR protein analysis have rectal carcinomas that are neoadjuvantly treated prior to surgery.  Furthermore, DNA MMR protein testing on all colorectal carcinomas, either by immunohistochemistry, MSI testing, or both, has quickly become the standard of care across the country.  However, the ""pitfalls"" associated with testing in the neoadjuvant setting have never been investigated.  To validate our initial observation and explore its clinicopathologic significance, we identified 50 patients with rectal adenocarcinoma who were preoperatively treated with radiation and chemotherapy, all of whom have available pre-treatment biopsy samples of their tumors. We plan to evaluate post-treatment tumor samples for immunohistochemical expression of MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 staining. Cases that show loss of expression of one, or more, of these markers, will be subjected to MSI testing.

In NSCLC, CTAg expression is associated with advanced tumour, nodal and pathological stages.  In addition, CT Ags NY-ESO-1 and MAGE-A3 are poor prognostic factors in adenocarcinoma of the lung. 
     Recently, our collaborators at the Melbourne Branch of the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research has analyzed CT antigen expression using paired pre- and post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy samples from 24 NSCLC patients. They observed a trend towards higher rates of downstaging in tumours that expressed NY-ESO-1 prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (44% vs. 0%; p=0.066).  In addition, they have observed that tumours with decreased NY-ESO-1 expression following chemotherapy were significantly more likely to be downstaged (64% vs. 0%; p=0.002).
     Given these intriguing results, they have approached us to expand the study cohort, under the hypothesis that expression profile of CTAgs in NSCLC may predict response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  

Aims: To immunohistochemically evaluate CTAg expression in NSCLC and correlate to clinical and pathological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

Methods: 91 cases with matched histology samples from pre- and post-chemotherapy have been identified between 1992 and 2008 in our hospital from Thoracic Surgery database of surgically resected patients with non-small cell lung cancer who received neoadjuvant treatment. These tumor samples will be evaluated for expression of at least five CTAg (MAGE-A1, MAGE-A3, MAGE-A4, CT7/MAGE-C1, NY-ESO-1) by immunohistochemistry (IHC).  Tissue microarray will be constructed from these cases (91 cases, two specimens each). IHC expression levels will be quantified, either manually or automatically using the Ariol system. (The 24 Melbourne cases were performed on whole sections). The change in CT antigen expression will be correlated with chemotherapy response, which will be classified as downstaged (decrease in TNM stage grouping*) or not downstaged. 
Statistical analysis will include estimation of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) by the Kaplan-Meier method using the log-rank test and Fisher’s exact test to determine association between chemotherapy response and CT antigen expression.

Chronic inflammation has also been linked to increased cancer risk.  Obesity causes sub-clinical inflammation, which may help to explain the increased risk of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.  A number of pro-inflammatory mediators (TNFalpha, interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6, cyclooxygenase-2-derived prostaglandins) can activate the CYP19 gene, which encodes aromatase, the rate-limiting enzyme for estrogen biosynthesis.  Hence, it is reasonable to hypothesize that obesity causes inflammation in the mammary gland (MG) resulting in induction of aromatase and enhanced estrogen production.  Chronically increased levels of estrogen could increase the risk of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.  To begin to investigate this hypothesis, we utilized ob/ob mice, a genetic model of obesity.  An experiment was carried out in which the histology and biochemistry of MGs harvested from ob/ob vs. lean mice was assessed.  Dr. Rhonda Yantiss, our collaborator from the Dept of Pathology, found both increased fat necrosis and an increased number of inflammatory cells in the MG of ob/ob vs. lean mice.  The morphology of the inflammatory cells was most consistent with macrophages.  In addition to the presence of an increased number of inflammatory cells, elevated levels of TNFalpha, interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6, cyclooxygenase-2 and aromatase were found in the MG of ob/ob vs. lean mice.  Taken together, we speculate that obesity leads to fat necrosis resulting in the accumulation of an increased number of activated macrophages.  Activated macrophages release pro-inflammatory mediators that could, in turn, induce aromatase in adipocytes, epithelial cells or fibroblasts.  If so, therapeutic strategies that suppress the accumulation of macrophages or inhibit the release of pro-inflammatory molecules could result in reduced levels of aromatase thereby minimizing the risk of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.  As a next step, immunohistochemical studies are needed to further characterize the inflammatory cell infiltrate and define the number and size of adipocytes in ob/ob vs. lean mice.  Dr. Yantiss has recommended that F4/80 staining be carried out to confirm that the macrophage number is increased in MG from ob/ob mice.  Additionally, S100 staining is needed so that we can quantify the number and the size of adipose cells in the MG of ob/ob vs. lean mice.",5,"ksubba","Admin Approved - DO NOT BILL THIS PROJECT - FUNDS ALREADY SENT TO PATHOLOGY - RK  Admin Approved - RK - 12/08/2010  Admin Reapproved - RK - 11/30/2011

The Hedgehog Pathway has been known to be an important influence in embryonic growth and development of certain normal tissues including mammary tissue in many animal systems. However, recent data has implicated increased signaling of the Hedgehog Pathway in some solid tumors such as esophageal and pancreatic cancer. Additionally, published results have demonstrated that increased signaling has been associated with residual or resistant disease after chemo-radiotherapy. There are implications that this signaling pathway may play a role in breast cancer as well, but there are no data to determine to what extent if any this pathway exists in tumors de novo, or if signaling may be turned on or affected by extrinsic forces on the tumor such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy. It is also unknown whether Hedgehog is related to known breast cancer variables e.g. ER and Her 2 status or is an independent prognostic variable for tumor recurrence.

PURPOSE, OBJECTIVE, and METHODOLOGY: 
Initially, we will evaluate the expression levels of both SHH (stromal) and Gli-1 (nuclear) Hedgehog proteins in breast cancer waste tissues to validate the presence of the pathway in breast tumors. We will examine 100 slides of documented cases of breast cancer tissue and quantify the intensity of the staining. One hundred slides will give us enough baseline information to prepare a grant application for an external fund. We will correlate the determined intensity of the staining with the known breast cancer characteristics of each case. We will gather known breast cancer characteristics of each case from issues pathology reports. The known breast cancer characteristics we will use include ER status, Her 2 status, grade, and proliferation index. Immunohistochemistry using commercially available antibodies against proteins of interest including SHH, Gli1 and Ptch1 will be performed on unstained sections of formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues containing breast carcinoma. These will be done using a standard immunohistochemical staining protocol which may include antigen retrieval methods. These stained slides will then be interpreted by Dr. Shin (co-I) who is a breast pathologist in the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College. Based on previous published studies, a scoring system will be devised to categorize cases into expressing and non-expressing groups. If results are promising, we will expand our investigation using more sophisticated, molecular-based techniques including in vitro studies, immunoflourescence, immunoblotting, cell lines, microarray gene analysis, tissue microarray, proteonomics, and mouse models.

The data will then undergo a thorough analysis to see if there are any trends that can be elicited from the results. Statistical analysis will be performed in the event that meaningful correlations are documented
upon review of the data.",12,"lir2014","Admin Approved - RK - 06//22/2009",1,12-JUN-09,"Immunohistochemical stains without providing reagent = $25 per reaction

Helicobacter pylori is also involved in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer. Gastric biopsies are the gold standard diagnostic test in detecting this organism. Mild infections are often not detectable by the routine stain (hematoxylin and eosin) used by pathologists when examining slides of mucosal biopsy samples and, thus, several special stains and immunohistochemical stains have been developed to detect organisms in these situations. This study will compare different staining techniques aimed at detecting Helicobacter pylori in routinely processed, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections, in order to determine which stain is superior. The procedure involves identifying appropriate tissue via an electronic medical record search, sectioning archival paraffin-embedded tissue, and staining the tissue with three special stains (Giemsa, silver and acridine orange) and one immunohistochemical stain directed against Helicobacter pylori. The microscopic detection rate of Helicobacter pylori using these special stains will be compared with the immunohistochemistry.
Criteria for inclusion include gastric biopsies from patients with clinical symptoms that may be associated with Helicobacter pylori infection, including, but not limited to, gastroesophageal reflux disease, abdominal pain, peptic ulcer disease, bloating, nausea and vomiting.

Our department frequently receives such cases in consultation for second opinion. We have observed over time that lack of objective markers of the invasion results in highly discrepant diagnoses from consultants in different institutions. In many cases diagnosis ranged from AIS through microinvasive adenocarcinoma to INV with corresponding treatment recommendations ranging from “no further treatment” to radiation and chemo-radiation. 
Three recent pilot studies involving small number of cases reported that prominent expression of laminin-gamma and cyclin D2 is seen in the tumor cells at the invasive tumor front in adenocarcinomas, whereas cervical stromal cells express SMA exclusively in the areas immediately adjacent to foci of tumor invasion. These initial reports require corroboration in a larger study in which the sensitivity and the specificity of these potential markers is established. Since our institution has a large collection of cases of cervical adenocarcinoma, such study is feasible.
The goal of the study is to retrieve 20 cases of AIS, 20 cases of AIS+INV and 20 cases of deep Nabothian cyst with inflammation and perform immunostaining for laminin-gamma, cyclin D2 and SMA.

In comparison to some other tumor types, e.g. melanoma or ovarian cancer, breast cancer has a lower frequency of CT antigen expression in general.  However, our recent study in collaboration with Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research showed that ER-negative breast cancer has a higher frequency of CT expression, particularly the so-called ""triple-negative"" subset of carcinoma (""CT-X antigen expression in human breast cancer"" PNAS, In press).  Most of the data to date, however, are limited to mRNA expression analysis based on microarray data.  We plan to validate and expand this finding by evaluating a large cohort of breast cancer cases at both mRNA and protein levels.  Specifically, a breast cancer TMA will be constructed with at least 300 to 500 cases, with at least 100 being the triple-negative cases. Dr. S. Hoda will supervise the TMA case selection, envisioning that this breast cancer array would become a resource for future studies on breast cancer. 

Tissue cores will also be collected into the tubes at the time of TMA construction for mRNA extraction and qRT-PCR analysis, so that the mRNA and protein expression data can be correlated.  This is important as some of the CT antigens might be regulated both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally.  

As an initial study, we also would like to use CTMA23, a breast cancer array of 100 cases (50 ER+, 50 ER-) established by Dr. Yantiss, to generate preliminary data that would help decide on the most promising CT antigens that should be evaluated for the larger cohort.

Recently, we validated previously reported overexpression of microRNA-21, -155, -181b, -221, and -100 in pancreatic cancer compared to non-neoplastic pancreatic tissue using qRT-PCR.  We also confirmed the over-expression of microRNA-21, -221, and -181b using the Luminex microRNA microarray assay which demonstrated striking increased expression of microRNA-21 in pancreatic ductal carcinoma.
Studies on microRNA expression in intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are limited.  These lesions pose a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic challenges owing to their biologic and pathologic heterogeneity.  For example, IPMNs may show a spectrum of cytologic atypia.  Low-to-intermediate grade lesions are usually clinically indolent and may not require surgical resection.  However, up to 1/3 of high-grade tumors are associated with invasive carcinoma.  We recently evaluated 8 carcinomas and 8 IPMNs using the Luminex platform and found that IPMNs show overexpression of microRNA-155, -375, -494, -21, -363, -524-3p.  Therefore, these microRNA species may represent potentially useful aids to the preoperative diagnosis and classification of IPMNs. 
Based on these preliminary results, we would like to evaluate the diagnostic utility of seleted microRNA species in a larger series of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas and in IPMNs.  Our aims are:
1.Retrospectively analyze the expression of microRNA-21, -221, and -181b in archival cytologic preparations of cases with confirmed diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and benign pancreatic lesions (e.g. chronic pancreatitis) as controls using qRT-PCR;
2.Use qRT-PCR to validate our prior observation that microRNA-155, -375, -494, -21, -363, -524-3p are increased in IPMNs compared to pancreatic carcinomas, initially using the cases evaluated by the Luminex array;
3.If our analysis confirms that IPMNs overexpress the above-mentioned microRNA species, we will then evaluate their expression in additional cases of IPMNs that display low-to-intermediate and high-grade cytologic atypia, in order to identify any relationships between the expression of these markers and degree of dysplasia in pre-invasive pancreatic neoplasms.

Interactions of hematopoietic cells with the stroma/microenvironment inside bone cavities are central to hematopoiesis as they regulate cell proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation (1-5).  HSC niches are specialized microenvironments that contain stem cells and regulate their maintenance. From mouse studies, it is known that cells at the interface of bone and the bone marrow (the endosteum) contribute to the creation of HSC niches. It remains uncertain whether this interface itself is a niche, or whether endosteal cells secrete factors that diffuse and stimulate nearby niches. Vascular and/or perivascular stromal may also create niches as HSCs are commonly observed around sinusoidal blood vessels, and perivascular cells. A vast number of BM stromal cells have been shown capable of secreting factors that regulate HSC maintenance/proliferation. As we said, most if not all the data are derived from murine models.

Unfortunately, ADT is only effective for a brief period before patients relapse and die from their disease. Overall survival is only slightly improved by taxane-based chemotherapy. The molecular changes associated with taxane treatment are currently unknown.  We strongly suspect that the recently described ETS rearranged PCa will benefit less from hormone-based treatment that non-rearranged PCa.  This is based on the overwhelming data that ETS rearranged PCa, most commonly TMPRSS2-ERG, are driven by one of three 5’ promoters (i.e. TMPRSS2, SLC45A3 and NDRG1) which are all under tight regulation by both androgen and estrogen providing a strong rationale for how these oncogenic fusion transcripts are active in states of normal testosterone (DHT) levels but can also remain active following castration. In addition, we have preliminary data from a clinical cohort of castrate resistant PCa subjects suggesting that taxane-based therapy will be less effective on ETS rearranged PCa compared to non-rearranged PCa.  Therefore, the overarching goal of an NIH-R21 proposal that I will be submitting is to determine the influence of ETS fusion gene products on the response of hormonal therapy alone versus hormonal therapy and taxane-based chemotherapy and to identify other molecules that will target fusion gene products.  For this I am collaborating with Dr. Alex de la Taille who heads the Phase II randomized trial, PR005, being conducted in France which aims to assess the potential added value of taxane plus ADT over ADT alone as an adjuvant for PCa patients with high risk of recurrence following local surgery. The two specific aims of this TRC project are: 

1. To perform molecular profiling using the Illumina DASL platform using formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor material from all of the patients enrolled in the PR005 trial (n=47) and identify target genes and signaling pathways that are associated with response in the context of ETS rearrangement.  

2. To create tissue microarrays (TMAs) from all FFPE material from the PR005 trial. These TMAs will be used to validate differential expression of proteins that are encoded by transcripts found to be significantly differentially expressed between the 2 therapeutic arms and in the context of ETS rearrangement.

I currently have all FFPE blocks for all of the samples corresponding the 47 subjects recruited into the PR005 trial.

The investigator thinks that the collected samples are very valuable, and his judgment is to be trusted in this respect. From a statistical point of view, a sample size of 47 can be sufficient for identifying differentially expressed proteins in the two samples. For example, with an 80% power, a two-sided t-test  can detect a difference of 1.5 in the means of the expression levels, assuming   a standard deviation of 1 in each sample, with a significance level of 1/10000.

The specific qualities of Multiphoton imaging that make it an ideal candidate for this purpose are: (1) ability to provide submicron resolution images of potentially diagnostic quality in terms of contrast and information content; (2)
ability to image live tissue up to depths of 500 ìm or more; (3) ability to provide diagnostic quality images in pseudo-real time (within minutes for relatively large 3-dimensional image stacks); (4) ability to generate images with high contrast and information content without the necessity of using exogenous contrast agents; (5) ability to utilize metabolic information from live cells, which may improve diagnostic accuracy over conventional histopathology in certain cases; (6) relatively high safety profile in living tissue, the tissue is only being exposed to relatively innocuous near-infrared irradiation for a very brief periods of time.
Overall study objective is to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of MPM to detect various types of skin cancers. We hypothesize that successful development of this technology will allow for improved judgment in
determining which lesions may need biopsy for histologic diagnosis with a consequent decrease in the number of biopsies performed. Methods: We will obtain biopsy and decisional skin specimens from consenting adults of both sexes attending the dermatology clinic at the Weill Cornell Medical College for scheduled biopsy of excision of skin lesions. At phase I which was currently approved by the IRB committee we will collect 20 specimens of normal skin samples discarded during Mohs surgery at our clinic
(“waste tissue”). This excess normal tissue will be scanned using the MPM and than processed for routine pathology preparation and microscopic images taken. We will use the tissue to determine the safety parameters for MPM scanning and determine the minimal laser energy and exposure level needed for satisfactory MPM imaging. We will also develop a scanning routine for MPM imaging of 10X10 mm skin samples and the stitching of mosaic images.
Phase II: Once a safe scanning protocol has been developed, pending IRB approval, we will collect biopsy and excision samples of skin lesions suspected of malignancy. We plan to collect 120 pigmented lesions, 30 suspected basal cell carcinoma (BCC) lesions and 30 suspected squamous cell carcinoma specimens (SCC).

We plan to study the clinical, histopathological, and immunohistochemical features of these twelve cases to further characterize CG in SLE.  The electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, and H&E/special stains have already been performed for diagnosis.  We will use immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections of the 12 renal biopsies to characterize the mature podocytic markers WT-1, synaptopodin, podocin, podocalyxin and GLEPP-1 and dedifferentiation podocyte markers dystroglycan, CD68, and Ki-67 to describe the podocytopathy.3

It is a neoplasm composed of germinal centre B cells, namely the centrocytes (small cleaved follicle centre cells) and centroblasts (large non-cleaved-follicle centre cells). Currently, FL is graded according to the number of centroblasts identified on H&E sections.  FL can be divided into grades 1, 2, and 3 based on the absolute number of centroblasts (large or small) per 40X high-power microscopic high-power field after evaluation of at least ten hpf (grade 1, 0 to 5, grade 2,: 6 to 15 and grade 3, >15, with subdivision into grade 3a and 3b depending on the presence or absence of centrocytes). Fl grading predicts clinical outcome.  Grade 3 FL behaves more aggressively compared to low grade (grade 1-2) FL.  In addition, FL containing diffuse areas with grade 3 histology is considered transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.  Thus, accurate and reliable grading is essential in clinical practice.

The current method of FL grading based on morphologic recognition of centroblasts and estimation of their number can be subjected to inaccuracy due to several reasons, including suboptimal fixation, difficulty of distinguishing centroblasts from the other larger cells within the germinal centre and to distinguish small centroblasts from centrocytes, We hypothesize that immunostaining utilizing antigens specific for centroblasts may increase the sensitivity, objectivity and accuracy of centroblast enumeration and will be an invaluable aid for FL grading.  In addition, these markers have the potential to further stratify germinal center B-cell derived lymphomas. 

Recently, CXCR4, Fc receptor homolog (FREB), and A-myb transcription factor were all identified as specific to centroblasts in reactive lymphoid tissues.  We plan to evaluate the utility of these markers in FL grading. Initially, we will test the feasibility of these antibodies on paraffin sections of reactive tonsils.  If these antibodies work well on FFPE sections with specificity to centroblasts, we will proceed to apply these antibodies to FL.  For this purpose, we will select about 40 FL cases with different histologic grades and growth architectures (follicular and diffuse).   Because of the need for examination of multiple section areas in each case, we prefer to perform antibody staining directly on each case instead of using tissue microarrays.",5,"wtam","Admin Approved - RK - 09/01/2009

CSCs may undergo self renewal, recapitulate the phenotype of the tumor from which they are derived, and potentially drive metastasis formation.  Such cells have been characterized by resistance to chemotherapy.  As such the existence of these cells within a tumor may indicate an increased probability of recurrence or death.  Several markers have been proposed as indicative of a lung CSC phenotype, including CD1332, ADLH13, EpCAM4,5, Shh/Gli16, and CD44+/CD24- (experimental data).  Similarly, elucidation of the mechanisms governing metastases development from these and other cells is of great importance.

AML is the most common acute leukemia affecting adults, and its incidence increases with age. 
The symptoms of AML are caused by replacement of normal bone marrow with leukemic cells, which causes a drop in red blood cells, platelets, and normal white blood cells. These symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, easy bruising and bleeding, and increased risk of infection. Although several risk factors for AML have been identified, the specific cause of the disease remains unclear. As an acute leukemia, AML progresses rapidly and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated.
Treatment outcomes for elderly AML patients have not substantially improved in the past 20 years. Older patients are less able to tolerate intensive induction and consolidation chemotherapy. There is an urgent need for novel compounds and treatment strategies for elderly patients with AML, particularly those with refractory or relapsed disease for whom there are few effective treatment options. 

Tosedostat is a new aminopeptidase (zinc-dependent enzyme) inhibitor, which in preclinical experiments has shown potent activity in both in vitro and in vivo cancer models as a single agent. In early clinical studies particularly good results have been observed in refractory and relapsed AML in older patients and these observations form the basis for the current study. 

Subjects will be randomized to one of 2 dose regimens of tosedostat which will be administered orally, once daily. The dose regimens of tosedostat will be:

In females, the result of this enzyme deficiency is the appearance of secondary male characteristics, which begin in utero; girl are born with genital ambiguity and an enlarged clitoris. Surgery to correct this ambiguity is done by pediatric urologists; however, the timing of this corrective surgery and pharmacologic intervention to address the 21-hydroxylase deficiency varies.

Androgen receptors  [AR] are found in female tissue.  Androgens may be important for genital development and function in females.

Efficacy of this regimen varies from patient to patient and is never indefinitely sustained.  Development of resistance leaves patients with salvage regimens that offer limited efficacy.  A better understanding of this docetaxel resistance would be beneficial for treatment of these advanced patients.  The mechanism of anti-tumor effects of docetaxel-based chemotherapy is believed to result from induction of mitotic arrest by inhibition of depolymerization of the microtubule, resulting in microtubule stabilization.  Microtubules are fundamental in mitosis and cell division and are made up of dynamic polymers of &#945;-tubulin and &#946;-tubulin heterodimers.  After assembly into stable microtubules, &#945;-tubulin undergoes several post-translational modifications, including acetylation.  Tubulin acetylation is a marker of microtubule stabilization and increases after treatment with taxane-based chemotherapy, however, whether tubulin acetylation is a marker of clinical response is unknown.

Previous work by our group demonstrates increased baseline levels of tubulin acetylation predict a shorter time to progression in patients with castrate resistant prostate cancer treated with docetaxel-based chemotherapy.

Gene amplification/protein overexpression is associated with a more aggressive clinical course and eligibility for treatment with trastuzumab. The addition of trastuzab to a chemotherapy regimen has been shown to improve disease-free survival among women with HER-2 amplified cancers.  Routinely, HER-2 status is determined by immunohistochemistry, with equivocal (2+) cases being “reflexed” to FISH analysis. 
SP3 is a novel rabbit monoclonal antibody that targets the extracellular domain of the HER-2 receptor, and has been shown to have a high level of agreement with the FDA-approved HercepTest. SP3 has been shown to have a greater discrimination power, i.e., proportion of results with a score other than 2+, while maintaining good concordance with FISH. This may be due to the reported stronger complete membrane staining and less non-specific cytoplasmic staining. Additionally, SP3 and trastuzumab share the feature of binding to the extracellular domain of the HER-2 receptor, which may make SP3 more clinically relevant.
The purpose of this project is to compare the sensitivity, specificity, and discrimination power of SP3 to HercepTest, and compare both antibodies’ concordance rates with FISH. We will also compare the concordance rates between different sized samples (needle core biopsy vs. excisional biopsy) to compare/assess the uniformity of staining with each antibody and whether this variable has any impact on HER-2/neu status.  One hundred patients with invasive breast cancer have been identified whose needle core biopsy and subsequent excisional biopsy contain invasive carcinoma. HER-2 status will be evaluated for all 200 specimens by SP3, HercepTest, and FISH. The results will be statistically analyzed.

Novel bioinformatics approaches have recently lead to a striking discovery indicating that around 50% of men diagnosed with PCA harbor an acquired chromosomal translocation that results in the fusion of the promoter region of the Transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) gene to the coding region of members of the erythroblast transformation specific (ETS) family of transcription factors, most commonly V-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog (avian) (ERG). Variations in the structure of the gene fusions in PCA yielding different fusion transcript isoforms have also been recently reported similar to the ETS family gene fusions described in Ewing sarcoma. The working hypothesis of this proposal is that the proteins encoded by the different mRNA variants have distinct biological roles. Our overarching aim is to characterize the different ORFs encoded by the fusion mRNA isoforms expressed in prostate cancer tissue and to study their role in prostate cancer development. We will develop in vivo models that recapitulates PCA cell line-stromal interaction.  For both Aims we will assess the functional role and define molecular signatures associated with the individual isoforms. For this, we will generate xenograft models using cells in which gene fusion products have either been introduced or knocked-down using specific shRNAs.

However, the origin of these hematopoietic precursor cells and the mechanisms underlying their development in the spleen is not well understood. EMH in these MPN cases is neoplastic and most likely represents metastatic seeding by neoplastic cells from the bone marrow (1, 2,3, 4). It is known that the spleen is a common site of transformation of primary myelofibrosis and other MPN to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (5,6). However, what makes the spleen permissive to EMH and disease progression remains largely unknown. The microenvironment in the areas of EMH in the spleen has not been studied. There has been only one study evaluating the morphology and immunohistochemistry of EMH in myeloid neoplasms (7). 
 
Our hypothesis for the pathogenesis of EMH in MPN is that hematopoietic microenvironments (niches) in the BM and spleen in MPN have their own distinctive characteristics that determine the hematopoietic stem cell/progenitor cell (HSC/HPC)  trafficking patterns. The interplay between the HSC/HPC and their progeny and the microenvironment results in the formation of dysregulated cancer activated niches resulting in depletion of the marrow HSC/HPC due to constitutive mobilization of HSC/HPC from the bone marrow into the circulation. These HSC/HPC home and engraft to an acquired hematopoietic microenvironment in the spleen. Proliferation and differentiation of cells results in disease progression.
 
The aim of this study is to evaluate the hematopoietic component as well as the microenvironment of the hematopoietic areas of EMH in the spleen samples from patient with MPN and to compare these findings with the normal spleen. 
 
For this study, files of the department of pathology will be searched for spleen specimens from patients with MPN. Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue will be utilized for the study. Routine H&E sections will be studied for morphologic evaluation.

Endometrial carcinoma is broadly categorized into two major types, referred to as Type I and Type II.  Type I tumors are the most common type of endometrial carcinoma and account for approximately 85% of cases.  In contrast, Type II tumors are high-grade, aggressive tumors and women with this disease often have metastases at the time of presentation.  Despite their low incidence, their aggressive behavior results in a disproportionate number of deaths due to endometrial carcinoma, with a five-year survival of only 10-30%. The most common molecular genetic alterations in UEC are mutations of the PTEN tumor suppressor gene and the PIK3CA oncogene.  Although the main function of the protein products of both genes is regulation of the PI3K/AKT/PTEN pathway, a key pathway in controlling many aspects of cell proliferation and cell growth, we have recently shown that mutations in PTEN are present in CAH and UEC, whereas PIK3CA mutations are largely confined to UEC.  Furthermore, estrogen and its primary receptor in the endometrium, ER&#945;, stimulate endometrial proliferation via activation of the PI3K/AKT/PTEN pathway. The overarching hypothesis of this application is that deregulation of PI3K/AKT/PTEN pathway by PTEN and PIK3CA  mutations and estrogen/ER&#945; abnormalities are central to the development of endometrial carcinoma.  The proposed set of experiments, using genetically based mouse models and primary human tumors, will define the role of the most common genetic alterations and their relationship to hormones on the development of endometrial carcinoma.

The current literature suggests that there exists some overlap in the immunohistochemical profiles among these tumors, namely metaplastic spindle cell carcinoma, sarcoma (primary and metastatic) and malignant phyllodes tumor. The distinction among these entities is critical since the clinical management of patients with these tumors is very different.  In a previous project, 37 malignant spindle cell tumors were retrieved from our surgical pathology breast consultation files and the immunoprofiles of these tumors were demonstrated using a spectrum of cytokeratin (CK) (AE1/AE3, CK7, K903, CK5) and a myoepithelial (M) (p63) marker.2 It was shown that CK5 and K903 were the most frequently expressed CKs in spindle cell metaplastic carcinoma. p63 was the most sensitive but not specific M marker for spindle cell metaplastic carcinoma. Immunohistochemical profiles overlapped to a small degree with concurrently studied sarcomas and malignant phyllodes tumors.  Additional immunohistochemical stains with increased specificity and sensitivity would be helpful in this differential diagnosis.

Three new antibodies have recently been described in the literature which reportedly are positive in the vast majority of metaplastic carcinomas, including the spindle cell type.  These antibodies are alpha-Beta -crystallin, laminin 5 Beta-3 and laminin 5 Chi-2. alpha-Beta -crystallin is a small heat shock protein that exerts cytoprotective effects and inhibits apoptosis. There is a commercially available monoclonal antibody to alpha-Beta -crystallin (clone SPA-222; Stressgen Biotechnologies, San Diego, Calif.)3 Laminin 5 is a 400-kd heterotrimer of alpha-3, Beta-3, and Chi-2 chains and induces aggressive properties in cancer cells (motility, invasion, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition.) The Beta-3 and Chi-2 chains are specific for laminin5 and not expressed in any other laminins.  Laminin 5 Beta-3 is marketed as Kalinin B1 by Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY. Laminin 5 Chi-2 chain is marketed by Chemicon, Temecula, CA.1  

The goal of this study is to stain the previously collected tumors with these 3 new antibodies. In addition, the entire panel of immunostains will be performed on additional tumors that have been collected since the last study, for a total of 50 cases. We will evaluate which immunostain(s) are most consistently and specifically positive in spindle cell metaplastic carcinomas as compared to other malignant spindle cell tumors with these 3 new antibodies and ideally, arrive at an optimal immunopanel to be used in this diagnostic setting.

Several in vitro observations suggest that vFLIP, a protein expressed during latency, is an important viral oncogene. It is essential for the survival of KSHV-infected PEL cells, mainly by constitutively activating the NF-&#954;B pathway. In order to assess the role of vFLIP in the pathogenesis of PEL, we developed transgenic mouse models expressing vFLIP in B-cells, by using the ROSA26 knock-in system. A specifically restricted expression of the transgene in CD19+ B-cells has been achieved by crossing the ROSA26.vFLIP knock-in mice with other mice expressing cre recombinase under the control of the CD19 promoter. These mice have also been crossed with the LANA transgenic mice to assess a potential synergistic effect between these two KSHV latent proteins in the lymphomagenic process of PEL.

The impact of vFLIP expression in B-cell development and lymphomagenesis in these mice is currently being studied by using molecular and flow cytometric analysis. Also, detailed microscopic analysis will be performed on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded specimens obtained from all organs, with particular attention on hematopoietic and lymphoid organs (bone marrow, spleen, lymph nodes, thymus), stained with hematoxillin and eosin, and with different markers involved in B-cell differentiation and proliferation.

Obtaining slides from pathology for DNA/RNA isolation, as well as for IHC, will help us to better identify and understand the genetic aberrations in the stem cell lines we have established--particularly those that are unique to the cancer stem cells (as compared to overall tumor tissue).

The aim of this study to is to retrospectively evaluate residual blast count using immunohistochemistry on marrow biopsies obtained from AML patients with CD34 positive blasts (~100 cases) between day 20 and 60 of starting chemotherapy.  Previously performed bone marrow biopsy and aspirate specimens from these patients will be reviewed.

They are diagnostically problematic because they are morphologically similar yet represent the pathologic spectrum of benign to malignant lesions. In a previous project, 29 spindle cell lesions arising in a pre-existing papillary or adenomyoepithelial tumor were retrieved from the breast pathology consultation files. A control group of 26 spindle cell metaplastic carcinomas (SCMC) unassociated with a papillary tumor were additionally retrieved. Immunohistochemical stains for cytokeratins (CK) (CK AE1/AE3, CK7, K903, CK5) and myoepithelial (M) markers (p63, CD10) were performed on a representative tumor block from each case.5 Additional immunohistochemical stains with increased specificity and sensitivity would be helpful in distinguishing benign from malignant lesions in these uncommon entities.

Three new antibodies have recently been described in the literature which are reportedly positive in the vast majority of metaplastic carcinomas, including the spindle cell type. These antibodies are alpha beta-crystallin, laminin 5 beta3 and laminin 5 chi2.  Alpha beta-crystallin is a small heat shock protein that exerts cytoprotective effects and inhibits apoptosis (clone SPA-222; Stressgen Biotechnologies, San Diego, Calif.)6 Laminin 5 is a 400-kd heterotrimer of alpha3, beta3, and chi2 chains and induces aggressive properties in cancer cells. The beta3 and chi2 chains are specific for laminin5 and not expressed in any other laminins (laminin 5 beta3: Kalinin B1 by Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY and laminin 5 chi2: Chemicon, Temecula, CA.)1  

The previously collected tumors will be stained with these 3 new antibodies. In addition, the entire panel of immunostains will be performed on additional tumors that have been collected since the last study. Given the rarity of spindle cell lesions arising in pre-existing papillary lesions, the goal of this project is to better define the clinicopathological and immunohistochemical features of this unique subgroup of breast lesions most of which appear to be spindle cell metaplastic carcinoma. To date, there are only 25 reported cases of this uncommon entity in the medical literature.2,3,4 Successful completion of our study will lead to the characterization of the largest cohort of this entity published in the current literature.

Over time, CLL may show an increase in cell size and proliferative activity as well as confluence of proliferation centers in lymph nodes and bone marrow.  A small proportion (<10%) of patients with CLL develop diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and <1% develop classical Hodgkin lymphoma. The median survival for patients with DLBCL (the so-called Richter syndrome) is less than one year. In RS, the tumor cells may arise through transformation of the original CLL clone by obtaining additional genetic abnormalities or represent a distinct neoplasm. The molecular mechanisms underlying RT had not yet been fully elucidated.

We have recently seen three cases which were different from classical CLL/SLL. Our cases were characterized by abnormally expanded proliferation centers containing a greater proportion of medium size atypical cells  (which may or may not  correspond to prolymphocytes) admixed with an increased number of  paraimmunoblasts. The three cases were distinct from cases previously reported as paraimmunoblastic variant/ transformation and cases of Richter transformation. They are also distinct from  cases of CLL in  prolymphocytoid or prolymphocytic transformation (CLL/PLL transformation).

Purpose and objective: The main purpose of this study is to understand better the biology of CLL/SLL.  We propose to identify and compare cases with increased number of atypical cells and/or paraimmunoblasts, which might correspond to accelerated phase of the disease and show a genetic / epigenetic profile &#65533;in between&#65533; a stable phase CLL and overt classical Richter syndrome.  The identification of specific genetic mechanisms involved in disease progression may provide potential targets for novel  therapeutical  intervention in this disease.

Methodology: Identify cases with typical versus atypical lymph node morphology (three potential groups may be identified: (i)  CLL/SLL with typical morphology (ii)  CLL/SLL with expanded proliferation centers (PC) but with normal mixed cell composition in the PC; (iii) CLL/SLL with expanded PC AND increased medium size atypical cells and/or paraimmunoblasts). Perform IHC with MIB-1, p53, ZAP70 and ISH EBER, as well as FISH CLL panel.

After the groups have been identified,  the   small cells and  atypical cell/paraimmunoblast rich areas will be compared in given cases and between groups with respect to the following:

   1. Gene expression profile, epigenetic signature, and possibly whole transcriptome sequence will be assessed after microdissection of the areas of interest (paraimmunoblast-rich PC, ,regular PC and small cell-rich areas)
   2. Expression of major signal transduction pathway components (e.g. NfkB, PI3K/mTOR, JAK/Stat, TGF-beta) and AID -- evaluated by IHC 

The 3 groups of cases need to be large (approximately 20 cases in each of the 3 groups), in order to achieve statistically significant results.

For the IHC, we are planing to use up to ~20 different antibodies. We  propose using a TMA with 6 cores per case in order to lower the cost and to minimize variation in immunostaining.",5,"sbarouk","Admin Approved - RK - 06/15/2010 Admin Approved - RK - 02/16/2012

Immunohistochemistry has greatly aided the ability to accurately diagnose these small foci, however, if multiple immunostains are needed, the risk of depleting the focus of interest in the paraffin block for this purpose is high. As tumor size continues to decrease due to improved screening and management of breast cancer patients, pathologists must also find an optimal way to handle increasingly minute foci of disease. Three immunohistochemical stains CK7, p63 and E-cadherin are often employed in parallel when further evaluating an atypical focus by immunohistochemistry. CK7 is a cytoplasmic stain that confirms the epithelial origin of a tumor. p63 is a nuclear stain that stains myoepithelial cells. Its absence around foci of carcinoma confirms its invasive nature where as positivity would indicate an in-situ process. E-cadherin is a membranous stain that is positive in ductal type breast carcinomas and negative in those of lobular type.

The admixture of carcinomatous and sarcomatous components has raised questions regarding the relationship of the two components as well as the cell of origin.  Studies have favored a monoclonal origin suggesting that the sarcomatous components are metaplastic.  However, the molecular pathogenesis of UMMMTs is still not entirely clear.     
Objective: PTEN mutations and microsatellite instability (MSI) are the two most common genetic abnormalities identified in type I or uterine endometrioid carcinoma (UEC), while p53 mutations are known to occur early in type II or uterine serous carcinoma (USC) and later in the high grade UEC. PIK3CA is the most common mutated oncogene in UEC and is associated with invasion. Furthermore, p16 expression patterns have been shown to distinguish USC and endocervical adenocarcinoma (diffuse/strong) from UEC (patchy). The aim is to study the molecular biology of UMMMTs by characterizing PTEN, p53, and p16 protein expression, mutational analysis of PTEN, PIK3CA, and TP53, and microsatellite instability in both carcinomatous and sarcomatous components, and compare the results to those in uterine carcinoma as well as leiomyosarcomas and low grade endometrial stromal sarcomas.

Currently, there are no markers that can reliably be used to distinguish complex atypical hyperplasia (CAH) from invasive carcinoma. Additionally, no single marker has been found to reliably predict clinical behavior of endometrial carcinoma.

Objective- We intend to identify novel molecular markers that distinguish CAH from endometrial carcinoma.  Protein members of the RAS/RAF/ERK, PI3K/AKT, and WNT signaling cascades are of particular interest.  The novel molecular markers identified will then be examined in histologic and clinical contexts in an attempt to correlate marker quantity with the behavior of endometrial carcinoma.

Methods- We will generate a tissue microarray of known endometrial carcinoma and endometrial hyperplasia from our surgical specimen bank at NYP-Cornell.   Molecular targets to be probed will be identified through a thorough literature review and translational use of an existing mouse model of endometrial carcinoma.  The tissue microarray will be probed with commercially available immunohistochemistry reagents to identify statistically significant fluctuations in molecular marker quantity.  Clinical descriptions of known carcinomas will be used to correlate molecular characterization with clinical behavior and markers will be evaluated for their associations with either CAH or carcinoma.

In MF-MPN abnormal hematopoietic cells in the marrow, in particular megakaryocytes by altering the growth factor milieu of the microenvironment, lead to fibrosis, neo-vascularization of the marrow and bone formation. These microenvironmental alterations are thought to dislodge the stem/progenitor cells from their niches in the marrow, resulting in increased stem/progenitor cell trafficking and hematopoiesis in extramedullary sites, including the spleen. Spleen in patients with PMF is thought to actively participate in disease progression by providing a permissive microenvironment for the abnormal stem/progenitor cells and by selectively interacting with subpopulations of cells belonging to the malignant clone. 

In contrast to the extensive knowledge obtained on microenvironmental control of hematopoiesis in the marrow much less is known about the microenvironmental properties of the spleen. In our previous project (13723) we identified different morphological patterns of EMH in the spleen in patients with MPN. We also observed a relationship between the EMH pattern, type of cellularity (lineage and maturity) and the stromal changes. As a second project, we would now like to study selected cytokines and chemokines (CXCL12, TGF-beta and VEGF) known to play a key role in stem cell trafficking and microenvironmental changes in MF-MPN using immunohistochemistry. The amount and distribution of these cytokines/chemokines will be compared between the spleens and concurrent marrow specimens, where available. Additionally trichrome and reticulin stains will be performed to assess the amount and pattern of fibrosis. Spleens with EMH secondary to non-neoplastic conditions as well as histologically normal spleens (secondary to trauma) will be utilized as controls. A total of 30 cases: 5 bone marrows, 25 spleens (including MF-MPN, normal and reactive EMH) will be studied.

Background:  The diagnosis of papillary breast lesions remains a challenge to even experienced pathologists, especially on needle biopsy specimens.  In many cases, it is difficult to determine whether a lesion is a benign papilloma, a papilloma with cytologic atypia, or frank papillary carcinoma, and the treatment and prognosis of each of the lesions is distinct.  Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) has been shown to be expressed on the vasculature of many malignant neoplasms but not on the vessels of benign tumors.  Our hypothesis is that PSMA will label the vasculature of papillary carcinomas but not that of either benign or atypical papillomas, and thus PSMA may prove a useful marker in distinguishing among these lesions.

Understanding the 3D structure of FDCs is critical to understanding the mechanism of B/T/FDC cognate interaction and B cell maturation.  Also, because the follicle is the major site of lymphomagenesis, a better understanding of this structure might lend insight into this poorly understood pathogenetic process.  It is widely believed that the structure of the follicle is provided by the FDC dendritic meshwork.  Our preliminary data, however, suggests that FDCs do not have “dendritic” (neurite-like) processes.  Instead, FDCs have folded cytoplasmic membranes into which B cells are embedded, like a raisin is embedded into a ball of cookie dough.  To test this idea and better understand the 3D conformation of FDCs and the follicle, we have begun a collaboration with W-C Institute for Computational Biomedicine (ICB).  In brief, we plan to stain FDCs and B cells in lymph node serial sections and scan the slides with the Ariol system.  We will then provide those scans to ICB who will use the images as tomograms, to construct 3D images of FDCs and follicles.  The initial work would involve only 30 serial sections from a single LN, immunostained for CD21 (an FDC antigen).  The scanned images will then be assembled into 3 dimensions in the CAVE facility.

We hypothesize that ß-catenin/TCF signaling is activated in breast precancers, and may be a useful target for breast cancer prevention.

IPMNs are subclassified based on anatomic location and morphology of the lining epithelium.  Branch duct IPMNs tend to arise in younger patients, are more likely to involve the head of the pancreas, and are more likely to show lower-grade dysplasia, whereas main duct IPMNs more often show high-grade dysplasia and are associated with invasive pancreatic adenocarcinoma.  Histologic subtypes of IPMN include gastric foveolar-, intestinal-, and pancreatobiliary-types, the former of which are usually low-grade and treated conservatively with clinical and radiographic follow-up.  The cytologic diagnosis of IPMNs is often hindered by limited sampling in endoscopically-obtained specimens.  Molecular markers to aid the classification of IPMNs and detect early invasive carcinoma in these scant specimens are needed.
In a previous study, we evaluated microRNA (miRNA) expression in resection specimens containing low- and high-grade IPMNs and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma using the Flexmir microRNA microarray and subsequent qRT-PCR for validation.  These studies revealed significantly higher expression of miR-155 and miR-21 in pancreatic adenocarcinomas compared with IPMNs, whereas miR-375 was more highly expressed in IPMNs.  In pairwise comparisons, miR-375 showed higher expression in low-grade versus high-grade IPMNs and the composite marker, 1.43*miR-21 + miR-375, distinguished between low-grade IPMNs and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
Based on these preliminary results, we would like to evaluate the diagnostic utility of selected microRNA species (miR-21, miR-155, miR-375) in a larger series of IPMNs.  We also plan to analyze miR-196a which was recently shown to have increased expression in the development of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), a pre-invasive epithelial pancreatic lesion closely related to IPMNs.  Our aims are:

1.	 Evaluate formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues from low-grade and high-grade IPMNs of various types to determine whether expression profiles vary with histologic grade and morphology.  Expression of miRNAs will also be analyzed for correlation with clinical outcomes.

2.	Evaluate cyst fluid obtained via endoscopic ultrasound biopsy to determine whether their expression may aid the cytologic classification of these neoplasms.  

For Aim 1: We will identify paraffin embedded tissue samples from 20 cases each of gastric-, pancreatobiliary, and intestinal-type IPMNs and 20 cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma associated with IPMN.  These cases will be analyzed for expression of the 4 miRNAs by qRT-PCR and expression levels will be statistically compared.  Eighty cases will by analyzed in toto. 

For Aim 2:  If expression of our previously identified markers proves useful in the classification of resection specimens, we will then analyze the corresponding fluid aspirates from these same eighty resection specimens.

Unfortunately, there are many breast cancers that do not express such phenotypes such as patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). These tumors’ lack expression for ER, PR and HER-2/neu. These patients constitute about 15% of all breast cancer patients and are characterized by an unfavorable clinical profile.  Genome-wide analysis of human cancers by cGH has identified amplification of the gene encoding the CUL4A ubiquitin ligase in 5% of familial and sporadic breast cancers, and up to 20% of the basal-like (TN) breast cancer subtype. In addition to gene amplification, overexpression of CUL4A has been documented in human primary breast cancers. Recently, CUL4A was defined as a direct transcriptional target of canonical Wnt signaling pathway, which partly accounts for high-level CUL4A expression. Therefore, aberrant expression of CUL4A, in part through Wnt activation, implicates a large subpopulation of breast cancer patients. These findings suggest the possibility of antagonizing CUL4A for the therapeutic intervention of not only TNBC, but also other breast cancer subtypes. However, the role of CUL4A in the pathogenesis of tumors has not been addressed due to the lack of animal tumor models in which CUL4A expression can be manipulated in a temporal, spatial and cell type-specific manner. Pengbo Zhou’s laboratory has recently demonstrated that the CUL4A ubiquitin ligase coordinately suppresses the nucleotide excision repair and the G1/S DNA damage checkpoint pathways.  They have generated conditional CUL4A knockout mice, and showed that skin-specific CUL4A deletion rendered the animals hyperresistant to UVB-induced skin cancer. Therefore, high-level expression of CUL4A compromises the DNA repair and DNA damage checkpoint pathways, and leads to accumulation of unrepaired mutations and genomic instability, thus facilitating malignant transformation and accounting for at least one mechanism by which CUL4A promotes tumor formation. The purpose of this proposal is to examine the aberrant expression of CUL4a, CUL4b and &#946;-catenin in archived triple-negative breast cancer specimens.  Our goal is to obtain preliminary data in preparation for a grant application for which Dr. Pengbo Zhou and Dr. Sandra Shin are co-PIs.

We aim to analyze gene expression on both a human Carcinoid cell line and patients? tumor samples. Additionally, we will compare the gene profiles with other neuroendocrine malignancies and normal gastrointestinal (GI) tract tissue. Our goal is to better understand tumorgenesis and progression and may lead to the development of molecular biomarkers and target-specific therapies for diagnosis, prognostication and treatment in Carcinoid tumors.

Bakground
Carcinoids tumors have an incidence of  5.25/100,000 patients, the GI tract  being the most frequent affected site. Within the GI tract, the small intestine (ileum) is the most common site (45%) followed by the rectum (20%), appendix (16%), colon (11%) and stomach (7%). Most cases are discovered incidentally and may remain asymptomatic for many years. However, delay in early detection leads to the presence of nonlocalized disease in 58-64% of patients decreasing the overall 5-year survival from  67.2% to 38.5%.

Methods
Microarray analysis will be performed on 20 Carcinoid tumor samples and on  a Carcinoid cell line. We will confirm the data generated by Microarray with qPCR.",5,"faheylab","Admin Approved - RK - 09/02/2010

In this study half of the people enrolled will take pioglitazone (Actos®) and half of the people enrolled will take an identical looking capsule containing no active ingredients (a placebo) for 24 weeks.  Pioglitazone belongs to a family of drugs commonly used by patients with diabetes.  This group of diabetes drugs has had helpful effects in experimental studies of various cancers. One of these cancers is head and neck cancer.  These drugs have been shown to reduce the growth of head and neck cancer cells in the laboratory.  Pioglitazone and similar diabetes drugs are currently being tested in human clinical trials for many different types of cancers such as breast and prostate cancer.

Systemic Sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that causes an excess of collagen and other proteins to accumulate, resulting in the tightening and hardening of the skin. In vitro-studies have suggested that Nilotinib may inhibit collagen and extracellular matrix production by scleroderma fibroblasts. In addition, Nilotinib has been both well tolerated by animals and an effective inhibitor of fibrosis in in-vivo animal models of fibrosis.
The primary purpose of the study is to determine whether nilotinib is safe and tolerable in patients with Systemic Sclerosis. However, a secondary purpose of the trial is to assess the efficacy of nilotinib. Clinical assessment of the degree of skin thickening is the principal method used to determine the progression of disease activity in systemic sclerosis patients. The Modified Rodnan Skin Score is the most widely used method to determine skin thickness. It is a technique in which the degree of skin thickening is assessed in 17 specific body areas by simple clinical palpitation. While this method has proven to be reliable and valid among multiple investigators, it's nevertheless a subjective way of evaluating patients in clinical trials. Thus biopsy specimens can be weighed to confirm the Modified Rodnan Skin Score.
Two skin biopsies (3mm punch biopsies) from the distal forearm will be done prior to initiation of treatment with nilotinib and after 6 months of treatment. We will do this by assessing histological change and evaluating change in various biomarkers in the skin. Additionally, we will validate the Modified Rodnan Skin Score's ability to assess skin thickness and changes in skin thickness.
One of the samples will be fixed in formalin for processing by the WCMC Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine. It is requested that the specimens at WCMC be paraffin-embedded and stained with H & E.

The Department of Pathology will bill the investigator for the technical services to embed, fix, process, cut and stain tissue. The tissue will be submitted according to the instructions for research only specimens. The other sample will be submitted to the Hospital for Special Surgery for processing in the research laboratory. RNA will be extracted from the skin and tested for gene expression by micro array and real-time quantitative PCR for all the above proteins. After RNA isolation, the RNA will be stored at -80 C.

Accordingly, the majority of studies focused on the correlation between hepatitis B viral antigen immunohistochemical staining patterns and histologic activity and viral replication have been based upon patient cases from these regions.  However, 12 million cases have been documented in the U.S. with more than 1 million individuals chronically infected.  As a result, our study will focus upon a uniquely U.S. based patient population of over 50 cases of chronic HBV infection.  This study will also diverge from prior investigations in that each case will have greater than one documented liver biopsy, allowing us to follow the progression of disease and correlate such parameters as activity, fibrosis, and viral load to patterns of immunohistochemical staining of hepatitis B core and surface antigens.   Clinical factors such as age, gender, race, mode of transmission, length of infection, treatment, HBV genotype, liver enzymes, and serum Hb surface and Hb e-antigens will also be examined in the context of the aforementioned parameters.  Prior studies have found increased nuclear core staining, elevated HBV DNA load, and decreased surface staining correlating with active viral replication.  Latent infection seems to exhibit an opposite staining pattern.  Conflicting results regarding cytoplasmic core staining and activity have been published, with some studies showing a strong relationship between the two in Hb e-antigen + patients and other investigations demonstrating a correlation regardless of e-antigen status.

We have developed a flow cytometric cell sorting method to isolate purified HRS cells from patient samples thus overcoming a major obstacle to the study of the disease (Roshal). We propose to compare the transcriptome expression profiles from EBV-positive and EBV-negative cases using full trascriptome sequencing. We will also search for novel potential genetic alterations, such as the presence translocations resulting in fusion transcripts. In addition, we will compare the HRS cells to CD20+ cells and T cells to determine whether the CD20+ (nonHRS) have evidence of being precursors of the HRS cells (for example if they also carry signature fusion transcripts seen in HRS cells). T cells will serve as somatic cell controls.

We hypothesize that J591 will be able to localize and image invasive PC site/s within the prostate gland. Because of natural barriers that affect mAb penetration into tissues, lower levels of PSMA in normal tissue and the loss of polarity and spatial restriction in cancer cells, this localization will be prostate cancer-specific. Hence, we set to investigate whether radiolabeled J591 can be used to accurately and reliably image localized PC foci and, therefore, potentially provide the requisite image-guidance modality for future organ-sparing treatments of localized PC. For 25 cases, we will compare pre-surgical 111In-J591 imaging results to surgical pathology results that identify site/s of PC. We will use autoradiography to demonstrate that the radiolabeled J591 antibody localizes to prostate cancer site/s but not to normal prostate cells, and we would correlate our SPECT imaging with PSMA staining to confirm that successful imaging is related to PSMA expression.",5,"sagitg","Admin Approved - RK - 05/03/2011",1,18-APR-11,"35 slides x $7 per slide (for Unstained Slides From Paraffin-Embedded or Frozen Tissue)

Most are well-differentiated and slow-growing; however, a subset are fatal, despite their characteristically indolent course. Surgical resection is the main treatment modality, but many patients present with inoperable tumors.  Although the genetic basis of familial neuroendocrine tumors has been studied extensively, genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that drive carcinogenesis in sporadic neuroendocrine tumors are poorly understood.  Recent investigations on pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors have revealed the biologic importance of several mTOR pathway and chromatin remodeling genes that may also serve as prognostic indicators and potential therapeutic targets.  TSC2 and PTEN, upstream modulators of the mTOR pathway, are downregulated or mutated in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and their low expression, detected by immunohistochemistry, is linked to poor prognosis.   mTOR pathway inhibitors were recently shown to prolong recurrence-free survival in patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors in a phase III clinical trial.  A recent study using whole exome sequencing showed that two newly described chromatin remodeling genes, DAXX and ATRX, are mutated in approximately 40% of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, leading to loss of protein expression by immunohistochemistry.  Patients with mutations in these genes experienced longer disease-free survival than those with wild type genes.  Finally, although several studies have revealed only rare P53 mutations in neuroendocrine tumors, mutations have been linked to aggressive behavior in some investigations. Similarly, B-catenin (CTNNB1) mutations have been reported in pulmonary, gastric, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and are associated with increased frequency of metastasis in some studies.  The purpose of this study is to evaluate the roles of these genes in neuroendocrine tumors, including those of pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, lung, pituitary gland, parathyroid gland, and adrenal gland.  Our aims are:

1.  Analyze immunohistochemical expression of mTOR, TSC2, PTEN, DAXX, ATRX, P53, and B-catenin in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues from neuroendocrine tumors to see whether different genes/pathways are involved in neuroendocrine tumors of different organ systems.

2.  Correlate expression of these proteins with clinicopathologic parameters, including tumor grade, pathological stage and, if possible, patient outcomes.

For aim 1 we will construct 3 tissue microarrays.  Two will be composed of 40-50 retrospectively identified samples each of pulmonary carcinoid tumors, pituitary adenoma, adrenal cortical adenoma, parathyroid adenoma, and 20 hyperplastic parathyroid glands.  The third will consist of 20 cases each of gastric, small intestinal, appendiceal, colonic, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.  In total, 300-325 cases will be analyzed for expression of the 7 antibodies.

For aim 2: Tumors will be graded and staged based on the AJCC 7th edition cancer staging manual and information regarding patient age, sex, and clinical follow-up will be obtained from the electronic medical record. Correlations between the loss of protein expression and these parameters will be analyzed.  

If our initial analysis reveals significant frequency of protein loss in any of these genes, we plan to evaluate their mutational status in the subset of cases with loss of protein expression.

Some cases of NLPHL show a morphologic and immunophenotypic overlap with T-cell rich/histiocyte rich large B-cell lymphoma which is a subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma  and sometimes with classical Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) especially the lymphocyte rich variant making it difficult to distinguish between these 3 entities. However, different clinical course and treatment for NLPHL, T/HRBCL and CHL warrant their distinction in clinical diagnosis. There are no reliable immunological markers currently available for the differentiation of neopalstic cells in NLPHL from T/HRBCL. When present, the characteristic finding of CD4+/CD57+ or PD-1+  rosettes around the neopalstic cells is useful in making a diagnosis of NLPHL over T/HRBCL. However, not all cases show these findings and PD-1+ rosettes can also be seen in some cases of CHL. Additionally, some studies have demonstrated the presence of MUM-1 positive T-cells surrounding the LP cells in NLPHL. The presence or absence of such MUM1+ T-cells in T/HRBCL and CHL has not been evaluated so far. 

The role of the reactive lymphoid cells especially the CD4+/CD57+ T-cells in the pathogenesis of NLPHL is unclear. Previous studies have demonstrated that these CD4+/CD57+ cells in NLPHL have a Tr1 cytokine profile and that some CD4+ T-cells in NLPHL are also positive for FOXP3, a marker expressed in most T-regulatory cells. Tr1 cells are a subset of  T-regs that may play a role in tumor immune evasion. Whether the T-cell rosettes around LP cells in NLPHL actually represent these Tr1 cells has not been studied so far. 
 The goal of this study is to evaluate if T-cells surrounding the neoplastic cells in NLPHL or CHL or T/HRBCL have a characteristic immunophenotype that can be utilized in the differential diagnosis between these 3 entities. Additionally, we want to evaluate if T-cell rosettes around LP cells indeed represent Tr1 cells. To accomplish these objectives, immunohistochemical stains (IHC) for CD4, CD8, CD25, FOXP3, IL10, MUM1 and PD-1 will be performed on 10 cases of NLPHL, 10 cases of T/HRBCL and 10 cases of CHL.  Should we find a characteristic immunophenotype for the reactive T-cells in NLPHL which is different from that in T/HRBCL, we will further evaluate 10 cases with a morphologic overlap between NLPHL and T/HRBCL with the above mentioned IHC and correlate the results with the final diagnosis.

In the reports published in Hematologica in 2010, the group observed that the microenvironment in nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma is molecularly different from the microenvironment in T-cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma. IDO, VSIG4 and Toll-like receptors are upregulated in THRLBCL and these features may be responsible for the recruitment and activation of T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. These gene may be related to a specific set of macrophages that are only enriched in THRLBCL.

Traditionally, the residual blast count is evaluated using conventional morphologic assessment on marrow aspirate smears as well as flow cytometric immunophenotypic studies (FCIPS). Both these methods require an adequate marrow aspirate specimen which is sometimes not obtainable in patients on chemotherapy. In such cases the blast count can be performed on the marrow biopsy using immunohistochemical stains. However, there have been no studies correlating blast counts on biopsies with clinical course and a comparison of counts obtained on biopsy with counts using morphology and flow cytometry on marrow aspirate smears. As initial part of our study (project ---) we demonstrated a good concordance between blast evaluation by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and that obtained by morphology on marrow aspirate smears and FCIPS. The study was presented at USCAP. 

For clinical purposes, following induction chemotherapy in AML, blast percentage by morphologic evaluation is known to be an independent prognostic factor. Given the fact that there are a few cases (~10%) that have discordance between IHC and morphology, we now want to see if blast percentage by CD34 IHC on post induction chemotherapy bone marrow is an independent prognostic factor in a multivariate analysis. This will be useful in CD34+ AML cases without adequate aspirate smears on day 30. To evaluate statistical significance a larger number of cases of AML needs to be studied.

Many oncofetal proteins have been identified as having clinical utility as markers or functional significance for pathogenesis in various organ systems, but there have been limited studies exploring the expression of oncofetal proteins in urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB).  One recent study characterized the expression of IMP3 in non-muscle-invasive UCB and found that IMP3 expression levels correlated with disease recurrence and progression (Sitnikova L, Mendese G, Liu Q, et al).  Fibronectin is an oncofetal protein that has been implicated in epithelial-mesenchymal transition and the pathogenesis of metastasis.  In a recent small study of UCB, the expression of fibronectin was associated with tumor stage (Richter P, Junker K, Franz M, et al).

Each patient will receive a maximum of 13 doses of PRAME ASCI, every 3 weeks for 5 doses, then every 3 months for 8 doses. 

This is the same patient population selected in the current Phase III study with recMAGE-A3ASCI, except for the antigen expression pattern. The PRAME ASCI treatment strategy seems to be promising in this NSCLC adjuvant patient population based on previous positive Phase IIB PoC study results in that patient population with MAGE-A3 ASCI that demonstrated to be in favor of the MAGE-A3 treatment arm.

Recently, a correlation between the presence of JAK2 and RAS mutated status in CMML and a myeloproliferative phenotype has been reported (5,6). Although the PB based separation has prognostic value, there is no information in relation to bone marrow features seen in these two subtypes. The aim of this project is to study bone marrow biopsies of CMML patients in an attempt at better characterize and possibly discriminate morphologically, immunophenotypically and from a molecular standpoint the two subtypes.

This project is in collaboration with dr. Umberto Gianelli, Universita’ degli Studi di Milano (Italy). Dr. Gianelli’s lab will perform all the immunohistochemical and molecular tests for the study. The pathology department at WCMC will provide unstained paraffin slides of bone marrow biopsies and clot sections of 30 cases of well characterized CMML obtained retrospectively from the Immunopathology Laboratory archives.

These MPNs are associated with abnormal trafficking patterns of CD34+ cells attributed to dysregulation of the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. Furthermore, the BM of these patients is exposed to a variety of cytokines that affect both cells belonging to the BM microenvironment and hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPC).  We hypothesize that distinctive hematopoietic microenvironments (HM) are present in the spleen and BM of MPN patients which differentially influence MPN-HSC/HPC proliferation and trafficking thereby determining ¬disease phenotype and progression. This hypothesis is based upon the assumption that HSC niches within the BM and spleen of PMF patients which nurture and determine HSC fate decisions are dysfunctional as a consequence of their close interactions with MPN cells and that such cancer activated niches (CAN) are capable of influencing MPN HSC/HPC behavior. We will test the hypothesis that the hematopoietic microenvironments in the marrows and spleens of MPN MF patients each have distinctive characteristics which determine CD34+ cell trafficking patterns.

Methodology: 100 spleen and 100 corresponding bone marrow biopsies from patients with myelofibrotic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MF-MPN) will be studied. Additionally 25 splenectomy specimens from patients with diagnoses other than MF-MPN will be used as controls. Routine H&E stains, special stains for reticulin and trichrome, as well as immunohistochemical stains for CD34, CD42, CD146, CD56, CD68, CD8, CD21, CD163, SMA, FSP, FAP, NGFR will be performed on the spleens and bone marrow cases to evaluate the spatial localization of hematopoietic cells and components of the hematopoietic microenvironment within the spleen and BM of patients with MF-MPN. Additionally, IHC for VCAM-1, CXCL12, osteopontin, stem cell factor, thrombopoietin, hyaluronic acid, fibronectin, VEGF, TGF-B, thrombospondin and placental growth factor will be performed to evaluate the differential cytokine expression in the marrow and the spleen.

These tumors tend to recur after initial treatment and also have shown a high degree of resistance to standard chemotherapy. Predictive biomarkers in targeted cancer therapy are major enablers of successful invention of therapeutics. The recent identification of extreme PARP inhibitor responsiveness in homologous recombination (HR) deficient BrCA mutant tumors is a notable recent example of such a biomarker (2,3). TNBC present a high degree of genomic instability and commonly harbor p53 tumor suppressor gene mutations (4). In the course of identification of p53 responsive targets that are altered in response to increased genomic instability, we identified several novel genes including ZNF365. Our preliminary analysis has shown that decreased ZNF365 expression leads to high basal levels of chromosomal instability, defective HR, and most importantly increased sensitivity to gamma irradiation and PARP inhibition.  Given ZNF365’s activity on major DNA repair mechanisms of HR, induction of ZNF365 by p53 under DNA damage in part account for the tumor suppressor activity of this pathway. Of note, recent genome wide association studies identified a specific SNP within ZNF365 locus for breast cancer susceptibility suggesting its potential role in breast tumorigenesis (5,6). Furthermore, publicly available cancer datasets show overall decreased expression of ZNF365 in TNBC (7). In light of these data, the goal of this project is to investigate the expression pattern of ZNF365 in breast cancer, in particular TNBC. We propose to use previously constructed CTMAs #46 and #47 consisting of approximately 200 invasive TNBC. In addition we will utilize fresh tumor and normal tissues from 10 patients and determine their SNP genotype and ZNF365 mRNA expression for purposes of correlation.

In our previous immunohistochemical studies of non-small cell lung cancer and carcinomas of the GI tract, we have found squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) to express CT antigens at a much higher frequency than tumors of other histological types.  In esophageal cancer, for instance, we have found two-thirds (13/21) of the SqCC to express at least one of the 7 CT antigens (MAGEA, NY-ESO-1, CT7, CT10, CT45, GAGE and SAGE) examined, in comparison to ~30% (13/39) of the adenocarcinomas.  During this study, we also found an interesting case in which the histologically normal squamous mucosa adjacent to cancer was positive for three of the 8 CT antigens tested, suggesting that CT antigen in SqCC could be an early event and that CT antigen might be useful in identifying early precursors of SqCC. 

Given the high frequency of CT expression in SqCC and the possible expression in precursor lesions, we intend to analyze the expression of the 8 CT antigens above in SqCC of the head and neck and esophagus by immunohistochemical analysis. Reviewing of cases between 2006-2011 identified 87 resected SqCC from head and neck, 32 resected esophageal carcinoma, and ~150 biopsy cases from the head/neck/esophagus in which squamous dysplasia was mentioned in the report. 

We intend to retrieve these cases and expect that approximately 100 cases of resection and 100-120 cases of biopsy will be suitable for this study. A TMA will be made from the resection cases, and biopsy cases will be evaluated on whole sections. All cases will be evaluated first with a cocktail antibodies for the CT antigens (which we have worked out in the lab), and p53 expression will also be evaluated in parallel.  Cases of squamous dysplasia that are positive for CT cocktail antibodies will then be tested for individual CT antigen expression.

Sporadic MSI-H adenocarcinomas have traditionally been considered to have intact APC/B-catenin/Wnt signaling, but aberrant nuclear B-catenin expression has recently been reported in sessile serrated polyps, the putative precursor lesions to sporadic MSI-H colonic adenocarcinomas.  This finding suggests a role for the Wnt signaling pathway in the development of MSI-H carcinomas.  Patterns of B-catenin expression in invasive sporadic MSI-H cancers, however, have not been systematically evaluated.  
The purpose of this study is to compare immunohistochemical expression of B-catenin in sporadic MSI-H cancers to that in sporadic microsatellite stable (MSS) adenocarcinomas.  In order to do this, we will identify approximately 40 resected colonic adenocarcinomas with lost immunohistochemical expression of MLH1 and analyze them for BRAF mutations, in order to identify a subset that are likely sporadic.  A control group of 20 MSS adenocarcinomas with retained immunohistochemical expression of mismatch repair proteins will be analyzed in parallel.  All cases will be stained for B-catenin.   Assessment for BRAF mutations would be performed by Dr. Wade Samowitz, of ARUP Laboratories, who will be sent unstained tissue sections for evaluation.  Immunohistochemical stains for B-catenin would be performed in the Weill Cornell Translational Research Facility.  Stains for mismatch repair proteins have already been performed for clinical purposes on all cases.   Based on the results of these preliminary studies, we may subsequently evaluate the molecular features of MSI-H adenocarcinomas that show aberrant nuclear B-catenin expression

In a retrospective analysis of banked paraffin embedded tissues, in patients in which clinical records prior to death are complete, sections will be evaluated for expression of proNGF, p75 and SorCS2.  We have validated antibodies that are effective on paraffin-embedded tissue, and the patterns of expression (peri-infarct, cell type specific expression patterns and duration of expression post-infarct) will be determined.

Lastly, we will perform target: tissue validation, as verified monoclonal antibodies specific for proNGF are characterized and available.   They will be used to detect proNGF in human autopsy specimens from patients succumbing to acute MI, as compared to controls dying of other causes. These studies will also be extended to other human autopsy derived tissue, to perform an analysis of proNGF, p75 and SorCS2 expression patterns in other organs.

Although the underlying mechanism is not well understood, it has been shown in mouse models that obesity induced inflammation is associated with increased levels of pro-inflammatory mediators (COX-2 derived PGE2, TNF-&#945; and  IL-1&#946;) and NF-&#954;B which, in turn, elevate aromatase expression1.  Histologic examination of obese mice revealed crown-like structures of the breast (CLS-B), inflammatory foci containing macrophages encircling adipocytes.  Macrophages have been shown to be the major source of these pro-inflammatory mediators in adipose tissue.  Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory mediators were paralleled by increased levels of aromatase in the mammary gland and visceral fat, suggesting a causal relationship.  This discovery of the obesity &#61664; inflammation &#61664; aromatase axis and its association with CLS-B in mice has provided insight into possible mechanisms underlying the increased risk of breast cancer in obese women2.  Moreover, ongoing studies on human tissue reveal CLS-B to be present in most but not all overweight and obese women and that the severity of breast inflammation correlated better with the level of aromatase activity than with BMI3.  We propose to utilize immunohistochemistry on reduction mammoplasty and excisional breast specimens to identify the presence of CLS-B with CD-68, expression of pro-inflammatory mediators and other related biomarkers including NF-&#954;B in order to support these preliminary findings in women.

Unfortunately, there are many breast cancers that do not express such phenotypes such as patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). These tumors’ lack expression for ER, PR and HER-2/neu. These patients constitute about 15% of all breast cancer patients and are characterized by an unfavorable clinical profile.  
Axl is a member of the TAM (Tyro3, Axl, Mer) receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family.  Activation of the gene occurs by binding through its extracellular domain or cross-talk via the interleukin-15 receptor or HER2.  Axl signaling leads to many biological consequences including invasion, migration, survival signaling, angiogenesis, resistance to chemotherapy and targeted drugs, cell transformation and proliferation, all of which are “aggressive” characteristics associated with cancer.  In particular, Axl plays a central role in mechanisms of invasion and tumor migration (metastasis).
High Axl expression has been observed in many human tumors and is associated with tumor progression.  For example, patients with primary cancers of the breast, pancreas, esophageal, lung, renal cell carcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, or acute myeloid leukemia whose tumors expressed high levels of Axl had shorter progression-free and overall survival.  High expression levels of Axl are associated with aggressive tumor behavior (e.g. tumor dissemination) and as such, is a excellent candidate drug target for therapeutic inhibition of cancer invasion and dissemination.  Blocking Axl signaling in Axl-expressing human tumors could lead to reduced tumor metastasis and improved patient survival.  Axl as a therapeutic target for patients with TNBC is promising.  
We propose to study the protein expression of Axl in primary breast carcinomas of different molecular subtypes and correlate with known clinicopathologic variables.  We will use already constructed TMAs (personally owned TMAs of Dr. Shin as well as CTMA 46 and 47) to stain with the Axl antibody.  Specific subtypes of interest include TNBC, luminal A, and HER2+ groups.  Normal breast tissue which is part of CTMA 47 will also be studied.  We will use the H-score system to score the extent/degree of staining of each case.

Morphologically, ACC is often heterogeneous and difficulty may arise in distinguishing it from other morphologically similar types of breast carcinoma, such as invasive cribriform carcinoma. Thus far, only c-kit has been found to be a useful immunostain when making this distinction, as it has been shown to be expressed in up to 100% of mammary ACCs.1 

Salivary gland ACCs have been shown to harbor a recurrent specific translocation t(6;9)(q22-23;p23-24). The fusion gene partners of this translocation have recently been identified as the oncogene MYB and transcription factor NFIB on chromosomes 6q and 9p, respectively.2-5 The MYB-NFIB gene fusion leads to the overexpression of MYB and subsequent activation of oncogenic genes involved in cell cycle control, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and cell adhesion. Using RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry for MYB, Brill et al.2 showed that ACCs of the salivary gland were more likely to overexpress MYB RNA and MYB protein than other epithelial neoplasms. 

Thus far, the MYB-NFIB fusion has been studied in only a small number of ACCs of the breast. Notably, almost all (~95%) cases studied demonstrated this translocation.5,6 The goal of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of this translocation and overexpression of MYB in mammary ACCs by FISH with confirmation by RT-PCR in a larger series of cases. IHC staining for MYB and c-kit will be performed. If the presence of the fusion is confirmed, overexpression of MYB by IHC could be a helpful diagnostic tool. 40 cases of ACC as well as 10 non-adenoid cystic breast carcinomas with a cribriform growth pattern will be studied.

After 10-15 years from the onset, PV evolves in a “spent phase” characterized by decreasing blood counts, worsening splenomegaly, and bone marrow fibrosis [1]. In advanced phases of post-polycythemic myelofibrosis (post-PV MF) bone marrow morphologic features can overlaps with those of fibrotic primary myelofibrosis (PMF)[2] and in some cases distinction can be difficult, if not impossible, especially when clinical history is not complete. However, in spite of the fact that both post-PV MF and PMF shares increased stromal fibrosis as dominant morphologic characteristic, the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms leading to post-PV and PMF morphologic appearance are most likely profoundly different: post-PV MF represents a late evolution of a clonal disease in which many consecutive alterations accumulate and lead to fibrosis deposition, whereas PMF shows an increase in fibrosis deposition from earlier phases of disease.
This study aims to describe the morphologic, immunophenotypic and cytogenetic features of these two entities, in an attempt to identify novel criteria, complementing those actually in use[1], to discriminate these two distinct clinico-pathological entities.
This project is in collaboration with dr. Umberto Gianelli, Universita’ degli Studi di Milano (Italy). Dr. Gianelli will provide 12 cases of post-PV MF to be included in the study. Blank sections of cases from WCMC and Milano will be stained at WCMC with H&E, reticulin, trichrome, CD34 and CD42b. Dr. Gianelli’s lab will perform all the other immunohistochemical tests for the study.  We may evaluate an additional 23 cases (WCMC), which may possibly be added to this study.

We have identified 29 cases with advanced diabetic renal disease and morphologic features of collapsing glomerulopathy presenting with new onset proteinuria, an association that is not known to be previously explored.  Information evolving from such a study may impact prognosis and therapy in patients with diabetic nephropathy.  We propose to evaluate these cases with immunohistochemical stains for WT-1, podocin, synaptopodin, and beta-dystroglycan, markers of normal podocytic differentiation which are lost in CG.4  These immunohistochemical stains have previously been worked-up and utilized in a similar project on CG in the setting of systemic lupus erythematosus (project # 13043).  Additionally, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) up-regulation in podocytes is believed to play a role in diabetic induced kidney injury.5  We will also characterize the immunohistochemical expression of VEGF in this de-differentiated, proliferative podocytic process.

In many carcinomas, their expression correlates with high tumor grade and poor clinical outcome.  These expression profiles make CT antigens useful diagnostic and prognostic markers, as well as attractive targets for immunotherapy.  

To our knowledge, CT antigen expression has not been studied in anal neoplasia.  The classification of anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) is often complicated by interobserver variability.  Although increased p16 staining is seen in high-grade AIN and Ki-67 staining correlates with the presence of HPV, interpretation of these immunostains is also frequently subject to interobserver variability.  CT antigens, if expressed in high-grade AIN and squamous cell carcinoma, would serve as additional diagnostic markers as well as potential targets for immunotherapy.  

We intend to analyze expression of 7 CT antigens (MAGEA, NY-ESO-1, CT7, CT10, CT45, GAGE and SAGE) in AIN and squamous cell carcinoma by immunohistochemistry.  We will study 120 biopsy cases which will include 20 cases each of the following: normal anal transition zone, condyloma acuminatum, AIN 1, AIN 2, AIN 3, and invasive squamous cell carcinoma.

Type 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma arises from complex atypical hyperplasia (CAH), which in turn is known to arise in a setting of unopposed estrogen stimulation of benign endometrium. Previous studies have correlated altered expression of molecular markers in both CAH and adenocarcinoma, particularly in the PI3kinase pathway. However, there has been limited research on how these markers are expressed in different phases of benign endometrium. 

Objective- 
We will correlate novel molecular marker expression in benign endometrium with marker expression in endometrial carcinoma.  Protein members of the RAS/RAF/ERK, PI3K/AKT and WNT signaling cascades are of particular interest.  Correlation between marker expression in benign versus malignant endometrium will then be used to better elucidate alterations in molecular signaling pathways in the progression from a benign to malignant endometrium.

Methods- 
We will generate a tissue microarray of benign proliferative and secretory endometrium from our surgical specimen bank at NYP-Cornell.   Molecular targets to be probed will be identified through a thorough literature review and translational use of an existing mouse model of endometrial carcinoma.  The tissue microarray will be probed with commercially available immunohistochemistry reagents to identify statistically significant fluctuations in molecular marker quantity.  The immunohistochemical expression of these markers will be correlated to their expression levels in previously prepared tissue microarrays of endometrioid carcinoma.

Researchers have developed prognostic tools based on statistical models to obtain the most reliable predictions for treatment success and outcome. However, these tools have limited ability to accurately predict outcome of these patients as they do not adequately capture the individual tumor biology and the clinical behavior of the tumor. Molecular markers provide insight into the pathogenesis of UCB and offer the potential for improving clinical decision-making. Molecular markers that are predictive of outcomes could help clinicians provide individualized prognostications and allow risk-stratified clinical decision-making regarding surgical and medical treatment. In addition, new molecular markers can serve as rational targets for novel therapeutic approaches and allow improved selection of treatment options for patients who will benefit from these therapies. Evaluation of molecular markers is commonly performed on large tissue microarrays (TMAs) built from human tissue samples to attain the statistical power needed. However, analysis of new, so far undefined molecular markers on large samples is expensive in multiple regards: time, effort, and costs. Therefore, it is useful to test potentially promising marker in smaller representative samples. We collected 35 of the most commonly used bladder cell lines in research laboratories. Overall, these cell lines represent the entire pathological spectrum of bladder cancers (low and high grade disease, non-muscle- and muscle-invasive disease, as well as lymph node metastasis). Construction of a TMA built using these 35 cell lines will allow us to test the value of molecular markers in two ways: 1) selection markers for in vitro cell line testing and 2) validation of cell line data on paraffin tissue prior to subsequent testing in valuable clinical samples.   Initial markers to be tested on the UCB cell line TMA include Her2/neu, EGFR, VEGF, SPINK-1, LSD1, and various hormone receptors, among others.

In summary, fundamental research on molecular pathways using immunohistochemical staining or FISH analysis of a TMA is important for a better understanding of UCB, including counselling patients regarding course of disease and planning targeted therapies. A first step to cost and time effective evaluation of a new marker is analysis of this marker in a cell line model, before use in a large patient sample TMA.

Brief methodology:
Each of the 35 cell lines has been cultured to a critical mass, transferred to, and stored in formalin, creating approximately a 1 cubic centimeter pellet of cells.  Each of these pellets will be processed similar to that for a cytopathology cell block, with centrifugation, routine tissue processing, and paraffin embedding.  The cell block can then be cored as with any other FFPE tissue for construction of the screening and validation cell line TMA.",5,"brr2006","Admin Approved - RK - 09/08/2011",1,05-SEP-11,"Paraffin block processing = $12 x 35 blocks = $420

Their incidence has risen from 1.09/100,000 in 1993 to 5.25/100,000 in 2004.   They secrete various bioactive substances and are known to have distinctive immunohistochemical staining patterns.  They are classified according to the segments of the embryologic gut from which they are derived (ie. foregut, midgut, and hindgut).  74% of carcinoids are found in the GI tract with the most frequent site being within the small intestine (45%), followed by the rectum (20%), appendix (16%), colon (11%), and stomach (7%).  

The prognosis of carcinoid tumors is generally good if caught early and there are no distant metastases.  However, if metastases are present, the 5-year survival decreases to approximately 35%.  This decrease in survival is primarily due to the lack of effective systemic therapies for metastatic or residual carcinoid tumors.  This has lead to the search for novel therapeutic targets for these tumors.  Recently, anti-angiogenic agents have been investigated for the use in metastatic carcinoid tumors.  Early basic science and clinical trials have showed widely variable results, highlighting the limited knowledge available on the expression patterns of vascular markers of these tumors.

Therefore, we propose a study in which we analyze the immunohistochemistry staining patterns of small bowel carcinoid tumors.  We will start with a preliminary group of 6 small bowel carcinoids.  As a control group, we will use appendiceal carcinoids which are usually very indolent tumors that rarely metastasize.

After completing study treatment subjects will be asked to return for long-term follow-up.

Objectives:
•	To determine if the 1-year overall survival rate of subjects age &#8805; 60 with FLT3-ITD AML treated with a sorafenib containing induction and post-remission therapy is significantly higher than the historical 1-year overall survival rate of similar subjects who were not treated with sorafenib.
•	To determine the rates of complete remission (CR), complete remission with incomplete count recovery (CRi) and cytogenetic complete remission (CCyR) to induction chemotherapy.
•	To determine the overall survival, event free survival, and remission duration of subjects treated on this study.
•	To describe the frequency and severity of adverse events for subjects treated on this study.
•	To describe the interaction of pretreatment disease and subject characteristics including morphology, cytogenetics, immunophenotype, molecular genetic features, WBC count and hemogram, and performance status on clinical outcomes.",5,"CALGB","Admin Review - RK - 01/30/2012",1,22-DEC-11,"Unstained Slides From Paraffin-Embedded or Frozen Tissue $7 Per Slide (10 slides)=70$

Robinson","212-746-2739","brr2006@med.cornell.edu",0,,"Metastatic renal cell cancer traditionally is considered a disease that is refractory to most systemic therapies. To date, immunotherapy has formed the mainstay of systemic treatment approaches. Until recently, high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) was the only drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration- because it leads to occasional complete responses and apparent cures. Unfortunately, only a minority of patients are eligible for high-dose IL-2 therapy, and only 5% to 10% of those patients experience this maximum benefit. Although renal cancer is considered a disease that is resistant to traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy, several lines of evidence suggest that the pyrimidine analogs have clinical activity. Specifically, 5-flurouracil (5-FU)  and its analogs reportedly led to objective responses in some patients, and activity was also observed with GEM and troxacitabine. Based on various single institution studies of the oral 5-FU analogs (CAP and GEM)  this multi-institutional study was started.

We collected nephrectomy samples (i.e. blocks and slides) on the 25 patients who were enrolled in this trial as part of protocol, and we now propose to stain these samples with two antibodies:

(1) Thymidylate synthase (TS) and

(2) Reductase ribonuclease M1 (RRM1), also called ribonucleotide reductase M1 (RRM1).

TS inhibition combined with incorporation of the drug into RNA and DNA are the most important mechanisms of action of CAP and GEM. The expression of TS provides an alternative source of substrate for DNA synthesis and positively correlates with CAP/GEM resistance in some studies. RRM1 is a key molecule for CAP/GEM efficacy and is also involved in tumor progression.

We hypothesize that expression levels of TS and RRM1 in pre-treatment samples of RCC (evaluated by IHC) will correlate with CAP and GEM sensitivity/resistance.",5,"brr2006","Admin Approved - RK - 01/12/2012",1,04-JAN-12,"antibody titration - $50 x 2 = $100

Immunotherapy (cytokine-based therapy with interleukin-2 and/or interferon&#945;), anti-angiogenic therapy (multikinase inhibitors including VEGF-R pathway or anti-VEFG mAb), and mTOR inhibitors are approved for therapy resulting in some objective response rates, prolongation of progression-free survival, and/or overall survival.

As immunotherapy remains one of the key components in the treatment of advanced RCC, further study is warranted.
PD-1 (or CD279) is part of the T-cell immunomodulatory system.

Morphologic evidence of inflammation is associated with elevated levels of pro-inflammatory mediators (TNFalpha, IL-1Beta, PGE2) that have been linked to insulin resistance and increase risk of cancer.  Although much less is known about the effects of obesity on the biology of bone marrow, preclinical studies in animals have demonstrated that elevated body mass index (BMI) is associated with adipocyte hypertrophy in the breast as well as the bone marrow.  Whether similar effects occur in the human bone marrow is uncertain.

Among the hematopoietic neoplasms, cyclin-D1 expression as a result of t(11;14) is a hallmark of mantle cell lymphoma and is seen in nearly all the cases. Cyclin-D1 expression in association with CDK4/6 leads to Rb phosphorylation and G1 to S progression in lymphoma. Aberrant expression of cyclin-D1 can be also seen in a subset of plasma cell neoplasms and hairy cell leukemia.  The pathobiology and the genetic events driving some lymphoid malignancies, like nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL), remain elusive. We collected a series of NLPHL cases and studied expression of proteins that have been previously implicated in lymphomagenesis.   We were able to demonstrate overexpression of cyclin-D1 in the neoplastic cells (LP cells) in NLPHL, a finding that has not been studied before. There is only one previous study that evaluated cyclin-D1 positivity in 3 cases of Hodgkin lymphoma. 

AIM: The aim of this study is to evaluate the frequency of expression of cyclin-D1 on the neoplastic cells in NLPHL and to study the mechanism of cyclin-D1 expression in NLPHL. 

DESIGN: 30 cases of NLPHL will be studied. Immunohistochemical stain for cyclin-D1 will be performed on all the cases. In cases with adequate material, dual staining for cyclin-D1 with CD20 or PAX5 will be performed. In cases with LP cells positive for cyclin-D1, FISH analysis for CCND1 gene rearrangement will be performed. Additionally, LP cells will be isolated from tissue sections by LCM, DNA will be extracted from these isolated LP cells and targeted sequencing of lymphoma genome will be performed in order to detect genetic events associated with this disease. The transcriptional program of LP cells can be interrogated in the same manner if more sensitive techniques become available in the near future. Initially, frozen tissue from a few representative cases will be used for RNA extraction and subsequent PCR for cyclin-D1 will be performed.",12,"sbarouk","Admin Approved - RK - 11/03/2011  Admin Approved - RK - 02/16/2012 Admin Approved - BH - 07/23/2014",1,28-OCT-11,"IHC:

Unfortunately, there are many breast cancers that do not express such phenotypes such as patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). These tumors’ lack expression for ER, PR and HER-2/neu. These patients constitute about 15% of all breast cancer patients and are characterized by an unfavorable clinical profile.  
Axl is a member of the TAM (Tyro3, Axl, Mer) receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family.  Activation of the gene occurs by binding through its extracellular domain or cross-talk via the interleukin-15 receptor or HER2.  Axl signaling leads to many biological consequences including invasion, migration, survival signaling, angiogenesis, resistance to chemotherapy and targeted drugs, cell transformation and proliferation, all of which are “aggressive” characteristics associated with cancer.  In particular, Axl plays a central role in mechanisms of invasion and tumor migration (metastasis).
High Axl expression has been observed in many human tumors and is associated with tumor progression.  For example, patients with primary cancers of the breast, pancreas, esophageal, lung, renal cell carcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, or acute myeloid leukemia whose tumors expressed high levels of Axl had shorter progression-free and overall survival.  High expression levels of Axl are associated with aggressive tumor behavior (e.g. tumor dissemination) and as such, is a excellent candidate drug target for therapeutic inhibition of cancer invasion and dissemination.  Blocking Axl signaling in Axl-expressing human tumors could lead to reduced tumor metastasis and improved patient survival.  Axl as a therapeutic target for patients with TNBC is promising.  
We propose to study the protein expression of Axl in primary breast carcinomas of different molecular subtypes (Luminal A, Luminal B – HER 2 negative; Luminal B- Her2 positive, Basal-like and HER 2 positive) and correlate with known clinicopathologic variables.  TMAs containing selected primary breast carcinomas grouped by molecular subtype will be utilized.  TMAs containing 160+ patients whose tumors exhibit the basal-like phenotype have already been constructed by Dr. Shin (CTMA 46,47).  Additional TMAs with comparable numbers of patients whose tumors exhibit the remaining molecular phenotypes will be constructed.  All TMAs will be cut and stained with the Axl antibody .  We will use the H-score system to score the extent/degree of staining of each case.  Results will be correlated with known clinicopathologic variables and compared across molecular subtypes.

In vitro growth inhibition is associated with mitotic spindle abnormalities, polyploidy and apoptosis. These effects have been noted in a broad range of tumor cell lines including those originating from HTLV-1 infected adult T-cell leukemia. Testing in the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program demonstrated the in vitro activity to be most pronounced in the ALL cell line panel with activity in Karpas-299 anaplastic T-NHL and Ramos NHL lines as well. In vivo, all 6 ALL xenografts achieved a CR after treatment with MLN8237. In lymphoma specific investigations, dose dependent inhibition of proliferation and apoptosis was observed in 13 NHL cell lines. Further, durable in vivo activity was noted in 3 DLBCL xenograft models. 

Subsequently, a Phase II clinical trial using single-agent MLN8237 in patients with relapsed refractory aggressive NHL has recently closed and follow-up continues. Forty-eight patients were enrolled including 21 with diffuse large B-cell NHL, 13 with mantle cell lymphoma, 8 with PTCL, 5 with transformed follicular NHL and 1 with Burkitt lymphoma. Patients received a median of 3 prior regimens (range 1¨C11); 11 patients received prior ASCT. The most common adverse events included neutropenia (71%), fatigue (60%), leukopenia (58%), diarrhea (56%), anemia (56%), alopecia (48%) and thrombocytopenia (46%). Serious adverse events in ¡Ý 5% of patients were febrile neutropenia (15%); neutropenia (13%), stomatitis (10%), pneumonia (6%) and deep vein thrombosis (6%). There were 4 deaths on study: 2 from progressive NHL (unrelated), 1 treatment-related due to sepsis, and 1 unrelated death. 22 patients required dose reduction to 40 mg BID, 21 due to AEs. Based on available data, the response rate was 30%. Additionally, there have been 4 investigator confirmed responses in 8 evaluable PTCL patients to date. Taken together, these data support further investigation of MLN8237 in PTCL.

To better understand the biology of PTCL, investigate the downstream effects of MLN8237 and identify potential markers of efficacy, additional translational analyses as part of this Phase II trial are proposed. Laboratory based correlative studies will include aurora A kinase gene expression as measured by fluorescence in situ hybridization in pre-treatment tumor biopsies for correlation with the clinical response rate. Second, tissue microarray analysis will be performed for patients with available paraffin-embedded tissue to investigate aurora kinase A and B protein expression as well as other candidate biomarkers in associated signaling pathways.

Alterations in this microenvironment can result in arrest of normal development and an imbalance between proliferation and apoptosis predisposing individuals to development of bone marrow failure syndromes and hematologic malignancies.  

Dr. Carlson has a novel mouse model in which deletion of the extracellular matrix protein, laminin, results in profound disruption of the morphology of the sinusoids and sinusoidal endothelial marker expression (ie VEGFR2 and CD34 but not MECA32), and there is splenic and thymic involution.  Megakaryocytes and early B-cells, typically found adjacent to bone marrow sinusoids, move away from the injured sinusoids towards the parenchyma of the bone marrow.  The mice become leukopenic, with a specific early developmental arrest in B-lymphocyte development in the bone marrow that is dependent on â-1 Integrin: laminin interactions.  Furthermore, in a pilot experiment with murine blast-phase CML, laminin-deficient mice did not support expansion of the leukemic clone.

At diagnosis and following chemotherapy, there are often markedly dilated and disorganized sinusoids in the bone marrow biopsy samples from patients with bone marrow failure and hematologic malignancies.  It is not known what significance this finding has to the underlying disease process, but our mouse data suggests that these findings may be part of the disease process and not entirely an artifact of tissue collection and preparation.  

We propose to examine bone marrow biopsy sections from a total of 50 patients with B-ALL, CLL, aplastic anemia, blast-phase CML and AML. Using immunohistochemical stains, we will characterize the number and size of bone marrow sinusoids, endothelial marker expression (VEGFR2 and CD34), localization of B-cells to the sinusoids (PAX-5), and expression of laminin and â-1 Integrin. Additionally, approximately 10 marrow samples from mice with deleted laminin will be evaluated for spatial localization of B-cells (B220 or PAX-5) in relation to the sinusoids (â-1 Integrin). The results will be correlated with the disease subtypes. These results will be used in conjunction with the results of mouse studies (performed separately in Dr. Carlson’s and Dr. Rabbany’s lab) for preparation of a proposal for an RO1 grant application by Dr. Carlson.

CUL4A and CUL4B are up-regulated through gene amplification and/or B-catenin-induced transcriptional activation in some human adenocarcinomas, including colon cancers.  In this study, we plan to evaluate the potential role of CUL4A and CUL4B in the pathogenesis of MSS and MSI-H subtypes of colonic adenocarcinoma and their precursor lesions, and in the mouse models of colon carcinogenesis.
Approximately 85% of sporadic colonic adenocarcinomas are microsatellite stable (MSS) and show APC/ B-catenin/Wnt signaling pathway abnormalities.  Dysregulated APC function leads to accumulation of B-catenin in the cytoplasm, which ultimately translocates to the cell nucleus and facilitates transcription of proto-oncogenes, including CUL4A.  Our previous tissue microarray analysis revealed overexpression of CUL4A in 53 of 138 (33%) colonic adenocarcinomas, 47 (89%) of which also demonstrated aberrant nuclear localization of B-catenin.  We hypothesized that CUL4A may be important in the development of MSS colonic adenocarcinomas, possibly with a lesser role in the development of microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) carcinomas, which have intact APC/ B-catenin/Wnt signaling.  We have tested this hypothesis by evaluating CUL4A and B-catenin expression in 37 colon cancer resections, including 20 MSS and 17 MSI-H tumors.  CUL4A overexpression and concomitant nuclear localization of B-catenin was observed in 50% of MSS tumors.  In contrast, only 3 (18%) MSI-H tumors showed increased CUL4A expression and none of these showed nuclear B-catenin localization.  These findings suggest that CUL4A facilitates the development of some colonic adenocarcinomas, possibly driven by the dysregulated APC/ B-catenin/Wnt signaling.  This notion is further supported by our observation of CUL4A overexpression in adenomas arising in mice with APC gene mutation [APC(min) mice].
Based on these preliminary results, we would like to further evaluate the potential roles of CUL4A and CUL4B in colonic carcinogenesis using archival human tissues and mouse models.  We will use formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens of tubular adenomas (precursors to MSS adenocarcinomas) and sessile serrated polyps (presumed precursors to MSI-H adenocarcinomas) and two mouse tumor models: 1. APC(min) mice that develop adenomas, and 2.Azoxymethane (AOM) mice that develop adenocarcinomas following exposure to chemical carcinogen AOM.  CUL4 or 4B knock-out mice will be used to assess the effect of CUL4 on tumor onset In these two models.  If the results of these studies are promising, we plan to apply for extramural fundings to support further research.
Specific Aims:
1)	 To compare immunohistochemical expression of CUL4A, CUL4B, and B-catenin in human tubular adenomas (n=40) versus sessile serrated polyps (n=40).

In many studies,  patients with DTCs have been shown to have significantly worse survival than comparably staged patients.  In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), although DTCs have been identified in 22-60% of patients with surgically resectable tumors, it is not clearly understood how these cells impact the course of the disease.  Some have proposed that the bone marrow may serve as a reservoir of tumor cells, from which they may eventually re-circulate to other distant organs and form overt metastatic disease.  Remarkably, even following complete resection of seemingly localized NSCLC tumors, approximately 50-60% of patients will recur within 2 years. Therefore, it would seem plausible that niches of tumor cells may exist in a protective environment away from the primary tumor until the metastatic cascade is activated.  
Previous efforts have focused on aspirated bone marrow.  For the current project we propose to examine fixed bone for DTCs as a clinical correlate to our in vitro laboratory work.

Patients with ATLL have a poor outcome with survival ranging from 2 weeks to about more than a year despite aggressive chemotherapy. These patients often do not make it to transplant because of chemotherapy refractory disease. Recently, a new antibody-drug conjugate (SGN-35) has become available for clinical use that targets CD30 positive neoplastic cells. SGN-35 has been demonstrated to be useful in cases of classical Hodgkin lymphoma and anaplastic large cell lymphoma, both lymphomas positive for CD30. 
CD30 is expressed in a subset of cases of ATLL. While there is a significant amount of literature on ATLL patients from Japan, there is not a robust clinical-pathologic experience in non-Asian patients. The incidence of CD30 expression in Japanese ATLL is thought to be 18%.  There has been a study done in HTLV-1 carriers from both Japan and Jamaica that found that soluble CD30 levels were higher in Jamaican carriers compared to Japanese carriers.  With that we hypothesized that while it appears the HTLV-1 viral subtype that has evolved over time is the same in both ethnicities, the host immunologic response may be different such that those who evolve to ATLL may overexpress CD30 on the neoplastic lymphocytes, a “therapeutic” target that has been shown to be efficacious in both cell lines and mouse models.
 The aim of this study is to evaluate the expression of CD30 on the neoplastic cells in cases of ATLL retrieved from our pathology database over the last 15 years (~15 cases).

Scientists have generated mixed results in regards to activation vs. inhibition of cAMP signaling in cancer cells.  For example, cAMP has been shown to both induce proliferation (mostly in hormone regulated cancers) and inhibit proliferation(1). These conflicting data has left the scientific community with an uncertainty as to the exact role for this important signaling molecule in cancer. However, we feel these prior experiments had major limitations since at that time only one cAMP-generating system was known.
About 10 years ago, an entirely distinct cAMP signaling cascade was discovered. We now know that two different classes of adenylyl cyclase (the enzyme that makes cAMP) control cAMP signaling; transmembrane adenylyl cyclases (tmACs) and soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC)(2). We have developed immunohistochemical reagents that can distinguish between these two enzymes, thereby allowing us to better study the role of cAMP in cancer.

            Using these immunohistochemical stains we have discovered that sAC is present in human tissue. More interestingly, we have also discovered that the staining intensity and localization changes depending on various conditions such as cell type, viral infection, malignancy, etc (3,4). As an example, benign melanocytes exhibit a perinuclear dot (Golgi-like) localization. This is in contrast to malignant melanocytes which have a strong pannuclear localization and loss of the perinuclear Golgi-like staining (4). Aside from providing important information about sAC biological activity, this information has diagnostic implications and is currently being used to assess melanoma in the clinical setting. More recently, we have also found that sAC is upregulated in prostate cancer cells as compared to benign tissue, and sAC expression appears to correlate with Gleason score and possibly indicate metastasis (pers comm, Brian Robinson MD, Weill Cornell). Because breast cancer, like prostate cancer, is frequently a hormone sensitive adenocarcinoma, we hypothesize that sAC immunostaining may provide diagnostic or prognostic information regarding various types of breast adenocarcioma (ER+/-, PR+/-.

This variability is dependent on a multitude of factors1. The use of immunohistochemical staining in primary tumors to detect estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) helps to determine prognosis and guide treatment in women diagnosed with this condition2. Over the past several years, androgen receptor (AR) has been found to be expressed in up to 70% of primary tumors. Its use as a prognostic factor and possible therapeutic target has not yet been definitively established but is gaining interest1 especially since some studies have found that patients with AR positive tumors appear to have a better overall survival3 and other studies demonstrating that AR positivity is maintained in distantly metastatic breast cancer lesions4. Furthermore, the breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA) is a genetic mutation which confers a greatly increased lifetime risk of breast cancer and when breast cancer develops, these patients frequently have more biologically aggressive, ER/PR/HER2 negative tumors. There is active research to improve treatment of patients with tumors resulting from this mutation. AR has seen limited study as a possible prognostic marker and therapeutic target in this population, especially those with the BRCA 2 mutation5. 

Due to the relative paucity of currently published studies about AR and breast cancer, the purpose of this study is to better characterize AR expression in selected cohorts of breast cancer patients who would potentially derive prognostic or therapeutic benefit such as those with breast cancer of specific molecular subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, ER/PR/Her-2/neu negative, Her-2/neu +ER/PR-), distantly metastatic breast cancer, regionally metastatic breast cancer, and BRCA+ breast cancers.

These women are at risk for subsquent neoplasms including angiosarcomas (AS), atypical vascular lesions (AVLs) and other sarcomas secondary to irradiation or chronic lymphedema.  Due to morphologic and clinical similarities between AS and AVLs, diagnosis may be difficult, especially on needle core biopsy.    
AS are the most commonly encountered post radiation sarcomas of the breast1 2 and are characterized by aggressive behavior.  AVLs are considered benign lesions without propensity to transform into AS, although local recurrence may occur.  AS show substantial biologic heterogeneity dependent on anatomic location, and occur in distinct clinical settings, for example following irradation or chronic lymphedema.  Furthermore, gene expression profiling separates AS into two genomic clusters, which correlate with anatomic location and prior radation exposure.3  Prior studies have shown that a high percent of secondary angiosarcomas show MYC amplification through gains in chromosome 8q24, which was not noted in de novo angiosarcomas.4  Additionally, high levels of MYC amplification by FISH has been detected in secondary AS, but not in radiation induced AVLs, primary AS or radiation induced sarcoma with non-AS morphology.5  Reports have shown good correlation between immunohistochemistry for MYC protein expression and FISH studies.6  Protein expression of MYC, evaluated with immunohistochemistry has been demonstrated in secondary AS, but not in AVLs or normal vessels and correlates with MYC amplification by FISH.7
The high predilection of MYC amplification in secondary angiosarcomas over primary AS suggests a distinct pathogenitic mechanism of AS in the setting of underlying lymphededema or prior irradiation. We believe that MYC amplification in secondary angiosarcomas of the breast in comparison to other radiation induced vascular lesions and other primary sarcomas, as well as the correlation of MYC protein expession by immunohistochemistry and MYC amplification by FISH deserve further evaluation, considering the possible therapeutic and diagnositic implications.

However, research has now shown molecular differences between subtypes of NSCLC (adenocarcinoma versus squamous cell carcinoma). There have been significant advances in conventional and targeted therapies as well. The Cullin proteins belong to a highly conserved family of proteins that form a part of the multifunctional E3 ubiquitin protein ligase complex and control a wide range of cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Cullins provide an elongated scaffold for the assembly of multiple subunits the E3 ubiquitin ligase. Through adaptors the cullins can target hundreds of known substrates, some of which are involved in DNA repair and DNA damage checkpoints. Among the seven cullins identified in humans, the CUL 4 subfamily comprising Cul4A and 4B play a pivotal role in cell cycle regulation and in maintaining growth and survival.  It has been shown that the Cul4A protein is responsible for suppressing DNA repair threshold and promoting genome instability and cancer development. Recent studies of transgenic mice for Cre-inducible overexpression of the Cul4A gene have shown hyperplasia of the lungs in regions of CUL 4A overexpression, eventually leading to tumor development in those regions. These findings together suggest that cells with high Cul4A levels are compromised in their DNA repair capacity, rendering the genome unstable and are predisposed to malignant transformation, especially when they encounter carcinogens such as tobacco smoking, environmental pollution, and UV irradiation. Cigarette smoking is a causative factor for lung carcinoma with 10 to 20% of smokers developing these diseases. We propose to evaluate the potential roles of CUL4A and CUL4B in lung carcinogenesis using archival human tissues. We will use formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue from patients with lung cancer (small cell, squamous cell, adenocarcinomas and patients with resection following neoadjuvant chemotherapy). Tissue microarrays will be constructed and immunohistochemical staining for CUL4A and CUL4B will be performed. 
We will construct tissue microarrays from patients with lung carcinoma (small cell, squamous cell, adenocarcinoma in smokers and nonsmokers and residual carcinomas in resection specimens after neoadjuvant therapy).

In fact, tumor tissues are generally stiffer than native, healthy tissue because of an increase in local extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness [1,2].  The increase in ECM stiffness is primarily due to increased collagen deposition and cross-linking within the tumor stroma.  Additionally, angiogenesis is known to be perturbed in tumor tissue progression.  Compared to capillaries in healthy tissue, vessels in tumor tissue tend to be malformed, more permeable and more tortuous [2].  In order for angiogenesis to occur, the polymerization of the dimeric glycoprotein fibronectin by endothelial cells is required.  Notably, increased extracellular matrix stiffness, vascularity, and fibronectin expression are all correlated with increased breast cancer aggressiveness [1,3,4].  
Previously, we have shown that matrix stiffening regulates the rate of angiogenesis as well as the resultant blood vessel architecture and integrity in vitro [5.6].  Specifically, we reported that the cross-linking of three-dimensional collagen gels modulates the formation of vascular networks and that endothelial monolayer barrier function is disrupted when the stiffness of the matrix is increased.  We have also shown that the synthesis and deposition of fibronectin is affected by the stiffness of the ECM [7,8].  Importantly, we have shown that the expression of a specific splice variant of fibronectin (termed “extra domain B” fibronectin (EDB-Fn)) that is normally only present during embryonic development and with angiogenic blood vessels is regulated by ECM stiffness.  Since EDB-Fn is generally undetectable within normal adult tissues, its presence in the in vivo breast tumor vasculature could lead to new clinical therapeutics.
Taken together, our data in vitro show that the mechanical properties of tumors influence ECM deposition and vascular integrity.  This proposal seeks to study whether similar trends are associated in vivo with breast tumors.  Our aim is to determine the relationship between fibronectin deposition, collagen content, and blood vessel architecture by analyzing normal and healthy tissue from breast tumors.  
We will assess the expression of fibronectin and collagen as well as the morphology of the vasculature of primary breast tumors using immunohistochemistry.  We expect that approximately 1-2 cases (approximately 10 slides total) will be used to validate the staining protocol.  To determine the relationship of ECM deposition and localization in relation to the vasculature, we will examine normal and tumor tissue from approximately 5 cases of primary breast tumors (approximately 2-3 slides/each).  We estimate that approximately 30 total slides of 6 cases will be analyzed.  The immunohistochemistry will be performed at Cornell University (Ithaca) in the laboratory of Dr. Reinhart-King.  Morphology and immunohistochemical interpretation will be performed by Dr. Shin.  The 6 cases suitable for this project will be selected by Dr. Shin and the slides will be prepared by the TRC.

Akt kinases are activated by PI3 kinase pathway. Activated Akt has been shown to interact with ER&#945; and androgen receptor, and so intuitively would seem to play a role in breast and prostate cancers among others1. A study by Nakatani et al. showed that Akt3 expression was significantly increased in ER negative breast cancer cell lines at both enzymatic and mRNA levels 2.  Kirkegaard et al. also found Akt 3 to be amplified by FISH in a subset of 10% of ER positive tumors 3.  Akt3 has not been widely studied in breast cancers and the mechanisms of its activation in breast cancer are just beginning to emerge. In a groundbreaking research on whole genome sequencing in breast cancer, Banerji et al. just uncovered a recurrent in-frame fusion rearrangement of MAGI3 (on chromosome 1p) and AKT3 (on chromosome 1q) in triple negative breast cancer 4. This was further confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. They also conducted functional studies and showed that this rearrangement constitutively activates MAGI3-AKT3 kinase and its downstream pathways. Blocking of Akt kinase by a competitive small molecule inhibitor (GSK-690693) inhibited the downstream activation. Triple negative (ER/PR/HER-2/neu negative) breast cancer is known to be highly aggressive and resistant to conventional chemotherapeutic treatment for breast cancer. If the presence of this rearrangement can be diagnosed by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) then this patient population with triple negative breast cancers may benefit from newer treatment modalities like Akt kinase inhibitors. To this end, we are proposing to develop and test a FISH assay to detect MAGI3-AKT3 fusion gene and to validate such rearrangement in a triple negative breast cancer cohort. In the above cited study 4 patient population was Mexican and Vietnamese. It will be relevant to evaluate the presence of MAGI3-AKT3 fusion in a more diverse patient population.
Aim:
After developing the fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) probe in Dr. Rubin’s laboratory, we will interrogate for the presence of MAGI3-AKT3 gene fusion rearrangement in a cohort 166 patients with triple negative breast cancer.  These patients’ tissues are already in the form of a tissue microarray (CTMAs 46, 47) and are ready to use.  If successful, FISH will be performed on additional TMAs representing the other molecular subtypes of breast cancer (CTMA 65, 69, 70, 72, 73) to determine the incidence of this rearrangement in triple negative breast cancer patients when compared to other subtypes. 
This study will likely have significant clinical impact given the potential therapeutic target of MAGI3-AKT3 gene fusion.",5,"sjshin","Admin Approved - RK - 08/02/2012",1,18-JUL-12,"Budget (for initial study on CTMAs 46, 47)

We have observed that lack of objective markers of invasion results in highly discrepant diagnoses from consultants in different institutions. In some cases diagnosis ranged from AIS through microinvasive adenocarcinoma to INV with corresponding treatment recommendations ranging from “no further treatment” to radiation and chemo-radiation. 
Two recent studies involving small number of cases of cervical adenocarcinoma reported prominent expression of metaloproteinases (MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9), their inhibitors (TIMP-1, TIMP-2) and p-cadherin in the tumor cells as well as in the fibroblast surrounding tumor nests. The staining was not seen in normal endocervical glands. The studies did not assess the staining in cases of AIS. 
The hypothesis is that the metaloproteinases, their inhibitors and p-cadherin have increased expression in invasive tumors but show lack of expression in normal endocervical mucosa and in AIS and therefore may serve as objective markers of the invasive process.
The goal of this pilot study is to collect 20 cases of unequivocal invasive adenocarcinoma, 20 cases of unequivocal AIS, and perform immunostaining for all markers. The staining will be assessed in the tumor cells, surrounding fibroblasts, main tumor mass and invasive tumor front, as well as in the surrounding normal glands and stroma (therefore tissue microray will not be suitable for this project).

However, more recent molecular based studies have confirmed that LCIS is, indeed, a non-obligate precursor to invasive carcinoma.  It has been also recently discovered that several variants of LCIS exist.  One such variant has been termed ""pleomorphic type"" and patients with this variant appear to experience a more biologically more aggressive clinical course akin to those with ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS).  Consequently, there has been an attempt by practicing pathologists to differentiate between the pleomorphic and classical types of LCIS.  Unfortunately, the main determinant is the difference in nuclear size and degree of pleomorphism, the assessment of which can be subjective and poorly reproducible.  A more subtle difference between the two types is the mitotic activity which may or may not be appreciated in all cases with routine microscopic evaluation. Phosphorylation of histone H3 has been found to be highly associated with mitotic chromatin condensation.  Moreover, immunostaining of PPH3 has been shown to be correlative with mitotic activity in multiple organs.  PPH3 is specific for cells in the late G2 or M phases of the cell cycle and could potentially be a more sensitive/specific marker for mitotic activity than microscopic assessment alone.  Our pilot study (TRC 14460) demonstrated a trend of greater % positive staining in cells comprising pleomorphic LCIS than classical LCIS.

Skin is the most commonly affected site while the heart and GI tract can be affected in systemic calciphylaxis. There are a variety of factors contributing to this severe occlusive microangiopathy including an underlying pro-coagulant state and ectopic neo-osteogenesis of the microvasculature through varied mechanisms, including increased osteopontin production by vascular smooth muscle and reduced synthesis of fetuin and GLA matrix protein, important inhibitors of ectopic neo-osteogenesis. Since, ectopic osteopontin expression may define a critical event in the pathogenesis of calciphylaxis, therapeutic endeavors designed to reduce osteopontin expression may be of value in diminishing patient morbidity and mortality.

A.	Triple-negative, distantly metastatic breast cancer has the lowest claudin expression followed by invasive breast cancer with regional axillary lymph node metastases and poorly differentiated ductal and lobular carcinomas.
B.	Molecular subtypes Luminal A, Luminal B HER2/neu+, luminal B HER2/neu-  with high Ki67-index, and BRCA-mutated breast cancers differ significantly in terms of claudin expression.

Ductal epithelial hyperplasia is often present especially in the early florid phase of gynecomastia. While in the vast majority of these cases ductal epithelial hyperplasia is benign and considered analogous to usual duct hyperplasia (UDH) in the female breast, there are rare examples where atypical features are found raising the possibility of atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) or worse, ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS).  Recently, the incidence of ADH was reported to be only 0.4% in routine pathologic exam of breast tissue removed for gynecomastia.1 The incidence of ADH outside of this setting is unknown but likely to be even lower as the male breast is typically non-proliferative.  Only two published reports of ADH arising in the background of gynecomastia have been described thus far in the literature.2,3  Overall, ADH arising in the male breast is poorly characterized and understood.

A diagnosis of ADH is clinically important as it confers an increased risk of developing breast carcinoma to the female patient.  However, rendering such a diagnosis by histopathologic criteria can be problematic and subjective.5,6  More recently, immunohistochemistry has been employed to help distinguish DCIS/ADH from UDH.  The most useful of these include Cytokeratin 5/6 (CK5/6) and Estrogen Receptor (ER).  CK5/6 is typically not expressed in DCIS or ADH while showing a mosaic staining pattern in usual ductal hyperplasia (UDH).  ER is often highly expressed in DCIS and ADH while patchy staining is observed in usual ductal hyperplasia7. The adjunctive use of immunohistochemistry has not been investigated in analogous proliferations in the male breast.  Furthermore, a rare report of “atypical ductal proliferation (ADP)”, defined by its authors as architectural atypia with no cytologic atypia or mitotic activity 4 has been described in the male breast which needs to be validated by other observers and further studied to understand its relationship, if any, to ADH and/or DCIS.

The goal of this study is to investigate epithelial proliferations arising in the clinical setting of gynecomastia by morphology and immunohistochemistry with the ultimate aim of uncovering defining features among different entities.  The study will include 50+ cases of ADH, 10 cases of DCIS +/- co-existing invasive carcinoma and 50 cases of usual ductal hyperplasia, all of which will be in a background of gynecomastia.  Each case will be evaluated on routine hematoxilyn and eosin (H+E) stained sections for its architectural pattern, cytology and extent of involvement.  Each case will have the lesion of interest stained with CK5/6 and ER.  This will be performed either as separate stains or a dual staining procedure based upon tissue availability.

Despite a recent decrease in breast cancer incidence rates, it is still the second most common cause of cancer death in American women2. The oxygen-sensing pathway contributes largely to the development of tumors, including breast3. One of the central players in this pathway is prolyl hydroxylase (EglN1, 2 and 3). The activity of EglN family members is intrinsically oxygen dependent and oxygen Km for the EglNs suggest that they act as oxygen sensors3. 

In our previous research, we showed that EglN2 regulates Cyclin D1 transcriptionally. Knockdown of EglN2 slowed the tumor progression in breast cancer4. However, the mechanism by which EglN2 regulates Cyclin D1 remains enigmatic.  We have developed an in vitro decarboxylation screen by using a breast cancer cDNA library and identified FOXO3a as a novel EglN2 hydroxylation substrate that mediates its effect on Cyclin D1. Furthermore, our research identified USP9x deubiqutinase as the critical player that mediates FOXO3a protein stability affected by EglN2.  USP9x locates on X chromosome, where X chromosomal abnormalities have been reported to play an important role in both sporadic and familial breast cancer5. In light of these data, we propose to examine the novel role of USP9x in breast tumorigenesis. 

The goal of this project is to investigate the expression pattern of USP9x and FOXO3a in breast cancer. We propose to determine whether USP9x expression could be used as a diagnostic marker for breast cancer considering its regulation on FOXO3a. We propose to use previously constructed CTMAs #46 and #47 consisting of approximately 160 invasive TNBC, #69 and #70 as luminal type A from 150 cases and CTMA #72 and #73 as luminal type B from approximately 200 cases.  USP9x and FOXO3a expression will be determined using McCarty’s H-scoring system. Biostatistical analysis will be performed on the scores across normal, TNBC, luminal type A and luminal type B for the association between USP9x expression status and clinic-pathological features. In addition, we will also examine whether there is correlative expression between USP9x and FOXO3a in these patient samples.

There are only rare reports describing the intimate association of certain metaplastic carcinomas, including metaplastic spindle cell carcinoma (MSCC) and low-grade adenosquamous carcinoma (LGASC) with complex sclerosing and papillary lesions. 1,2 Cases demonstrating this interesting association have also been collected at this institution, the preliminary results of which were presented as a platform at the USCAP meeting in 2007.3 We have subsequently collected additional cases and have performed a series of immunohistochemical stains pertinent to metaplastic carcinoma, including p63, various cytokeratins, and basal-like markers (TRC Project 14240).  However, to date, we and others have yet to elucidate, immunohistochemically or otherwise, this uncommon association between seemingly unrelated entities and the biologic underpinnings of this relationship.
	 Recently, PIK3CA/AKT pathway mutations have been identified in papillary neoplasms of the breast, and are interestingly seen more frequently in benign lesions (papillomas), indicating that most papillary carcinomas evolve via a different molecular pathway.4 
	We plan to investigate the presence of activation of the PIK3CA/AKT pathway in papillary tumors in our study and the metaplastic carcinomas arising within them using immunohistochemistry. Control groups of papillomas and papillary carcinomas without association with or giving rise to metaplastic carcinomas will be studied in concert.  Two immunostains, mTOR and stathmin, will be performed on paraffin tissue sections from study cases. Stathmin, encoded by the gene STMN1, is a protein involved in regulating microtubule dynamics. Stathmin expression has been shown to correlate with activation of the PIK3CA/AKT pathway and immunohistochemical staining for stathmin has been used as a surrogate for PIK3CA/AKT pathway activation.5-7 Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a protein kinase downstream from AKT which is activated and phosphorylated by AKT. mTOR protein expression by immunohistochemistry is indicative of PIK3CA/AKT pathway activation and has been used a surrogate in this setting.8

A spectrum of cystic hypersecretory lesions can be observed which range from benign cystic hypersecretory hyperplasia to cystic hypersecretory carcinoma (CHC). These lesions are often found in association with pregnancy-like change/hyperplasia.1, 2 
CHC is a rare variant of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) which is thought to be a low-grade lesion that behaves in an indolent manner. Some reports, however, have shown invasive carcinoma arising in association with CHC, which is typically poorly-differentiated and lacks a cystic hypersecretory appearance.3-5 Additionally, nodal as well as distant metastases have been reported. Because of its rarity, the literature describing the clinical and pathologic features of CHC is limited to small case series. Few studies have reported the immunohistochemical staining patterns of this distinctive lesion and the immunohistochemical profile of CHC is not well-understood. Specifically, variable staining has been seen with estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR),5-7 which have important clinical and treatment implications, and most reports have shown these markers to be negative in CHC. Additionally, overexpression of HER-2/neu protein, another prognostic and predictive marker, has been seen in CHC.5 Androgen receptor, a marker frequently expressed in lesions with apocrine differentiation, has been shown to be expressed in the few cases of CHC studied.5 Finally, the distinctive luminal secretion present in CHC may stain with histochemical stains including PAS, mucicarmine, and alcian blue, as well as the carcinonoembryonic antigen (CEA) and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) immunohistochemical stains, 4, 6, 7 however these stains so far have been of limited diagnostic value.   
In this study we plan to characterize the immunohistochemical profile of CHC. Specifically, we will investigate the staining characteristics of CHC with ER, Ki67, and HER-2/neu to better define expression of these important biomarkers. Because CHC has been shown to lack reactivity for ER and PR, this tumor, although unlikely, may show a basal-like molecular profile. We would like to investigate this by performing CK14 and EGFR stains, basal-like immunohistochemical markers which show reactivity in basal-like breast cancers and have been used as a surrogate for molecular analysis. Immunohistochemical staining with androgen receptor will be performed in all cases to confirm that CHC expresses this marker and possibly represents a lesion with apocrine differentiation. Few reports have shown that some apocrine lesions, while clearly not invasive, show lack of reactivity for myoepithelial stains,8, 9 markers pathologists frequently employ to determine whether a tumor is invasive. This inconsistent an unreliable pattern of myoepithelial staining needs to be further investigated, and we plan to subject all cases to two myoepithelial stains, one of which would include p63. Finally, with respect to the luminal secretion present in CHC, we plan on performing CEA and EMA stains to better define what has been reported in the literature. 
In summary, ten immunohistochemical stains on thirty cases of CHC will be performed. This study will better define the clinical, pathologic, and immunohistochemical features of this poorly-understood entity.",5,"sjshin","Admin Approved - RK - 05/22/2012",1,16-MAY-12,"1.

More recently, however, analyses have shown that HPs show mutations in BRAF V600E in 40-76% of cases.   Sessile serrated polyps (SSPs) are closely related nondysplastic serrated lesions that also frequently harbor mutations in BRAF V600E and are thought to be the possible precursor to invasive adenocarcinoma with a high degree of microsatellite instability (MSI-H), and this malignant transformation is heralded by the appearance of cytologic dysplasia in SSPs.  It is currently believed that BRAF mutated cells are prone to promoter methylation, and this epigenetic silencing could affect key mismatch repair genes, particularly MLH1, and ultimately result in invasive adenocarcinoma.  This sequence of events has been termed the “serrated neoplastic pathway” in colon carcinogenesis.  The finding of BRAF V600E mutation-positive HPs suggests that some of these lesions may in fact be the first step in the pathway to MSI-H adenocarcinomas.
In previous Sanger sequencing analysis, we have noted that BRAF V600E mutated cells represent only a subset of cells within mutation-positive HPs, indicating that the mutation involves only a subset of the lesional cells and not a clonal event.  The specific cell population harboring these mutations is unknown.  Recently, a mutation-specific antibody to BRAF V600E has become commercially available. This antibody will allow localization of the specific cell population that harbors the BRAF V600E mutation and may also prove clinically useful in identifying patients with SSP that are at risk for neoplastic progression. The aims of the current study are twofold:
1.	To evaluate the sensitivity/specificity of the BRAF V600E antibody.
2.	To evaluate the distribution and extent of BRAF V600E mutations in the spectrum of lesions of the serrated neoplastic pathway, thus identifying the specific mutation-positive cell population and testing the hypothesis that BRAF V600E mutated cells become increasingly dominant as the pathway progresses.
In order to do this, we will:
1.	Identify 20 cases of MSI-H adenocarcinoma with known BRAF V600E mutation, and 50 cases of HP, SSP, and SSP with dysplasia from our previous study cohorts and the pathology database.
2.	Analyze the concordance between immunohistochemical BRAF staining and BRAF V600E mutational status in the 20 BRAF-mutated invasive adenocarcinoma specimens.
3.	Analyze the pattern of BRAF V600E immunostaining (i.e. percentage of mutated cells, localization to deep or superficial compartment of the lesion, etc.) in lesions of the serrated neoplastic pathway, and correlate the findings with the morphology, presence or absence of dysplasia, and the BRAF mutation status (for cases that have previously been typed).",5,"Nicole Panarelli","Admin Approved - RK - 07/09/2013",1,03-JUL-13,"Purchase and work-up of the BRAFV600E antibody: $300

Treatment options for these patients have increased in recent years. With the recent addition of trastuzumab to the options for patients with HER2-positive disease, further exploration of additional lines of HER2-directed therapy is warranted.  Most patients do not receive second-line therapy on account of factors related to the underlying disease as well as potential intolerance to further treatment. Consequently, second-line therapies for advanced GC must not only demonstrate antitumor activity but must also minimize the toxicities commonly associated with currently available agents used in GC treatment. In this regard, based on the clinical experience in MBC to date, trastuzumab emtansine has the potential to fulfill this need as second-line therapy for advanced HER2-positive GC.  Trastuzumab emtansine (as known as T-DM1) is a novel antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). Antibody-drug conjugates represent a new approach to conferring selectivity to highly potent cytotoxic agents. Linking a cytotoxic agent to highly specific monoclonal antibodies targeting unique and/or overexpressed cell surface tumor antigens focuses the delivery of such agents to tumor cells, potentially creating a more favorable therapeutic window than could be achieved by their administration as free drugs. Trastuzumab emtansine is specifically designed for the treatment of HER2-positive cancer.

Pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia (PASH) is a CD34+, hormone receptor-positive, myofibroblastic proliferation of mammary stroma. PASH is thought to be at one end of a spectrum of myofibroblastic proliferations of the breast that also includes myofibroblastoma and low-grade myofibroblastic sarcoma. PASH bears morphologic similarity with myofibroblastoma, especially when it is fascicular in appearance, and like myofibroblastoma, PASH expresses CD34 and hormone receptors. PASH can occur as an isolated incidental finding, as a mass-forming lesion, and may occur in the stroma of phyllodes tumors and gynecomastia. PASH is frequently present in breast tissue adjacent to myofibroblastoma. For these reasons, PASH is thought to be related to myofibroblastoma, although the precise etiology of PASH is unknown and a genetic link between these entities has not been reported. 
Our hypothesis is that PASH, like myofibroblastoma, shows loss of the 13q14 region.  We plan to study a series of cases of PASH and myofibroblastoma by FISH to support or refute this. One TMA will be constructed which will contain 50 cases of PASH and will include cases that occur in the various settings mentioned above. Approximately 20 cases of myofibroblastoma will also be included in the TMA.",5,"tdalfo01","Admin Approved - RK - 08/05/2013",1,24-JUL-13,"Budget:

Dr. Neil Renwick in the Laboratory of RNA Molecular Biology at Rockefeller University performs miRNA profiling by sequencing and has developed miRNA in situ hybridization that localizes miRNA alteration in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues (FFPE).  In collaboration with Dr. Renwick, we plan to perform miRNA sequencing and profiling in selected preinvasive and invasive pancreatic, GI, and non-GI tumors.  Potential miRNA biomarkers identified will then be analyzed by FISH to validate their altered expression in tumor at tissue and cellular levels. Specific tumor types selected for analysis and the rationale for their selection are: 
1.	Pancreatic tumors:  Most pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas arise from pre-existing lesions termed pancreatic intraductal neoplasia (PanIN), whereas a smaller proportion result from malignant transformation of cystic tumors called intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN).  Both PanIN and IPMNs display a spectrum of dysplasia, ranging from low-grade to carcinoma in situ.  Current techniques and markers cannot reliably distinguish high-grade and low-grade lesions, and identification of additional molecular markers would aid patient management. 
2.	Neuroendocrine tumors: Well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (ETs) of the gastrointestinal tract are clinically heterogeneous. Some are indolent, but many have fatal consequences.  Recent evidence indicates that ETs from different gastrointestinal sites progress via diverse molecular mechanisms.  Those from the foregut (e.g. pancreas) often harbor mutations in MEN1, VHL, and TSC1/2.  ETs of the midgut (e.g. ileum) display deletions on chromosome 18 and abnormal Wnt signaling.  Hindgut (e.g. rectum) ETs show high expression of TGF&#61537;&#61472; and its cell surface receptors, EGFR, and NOTCH.  MiRNA expression patterns may also differ among ETs and may provide potential diagnostic or prognostic indicators.
3.	Germ cell tumors: Seminoma expresses multiple germ-cell specific markers, (e.g. OCT 3/4, cancer/testis antigens).  They also harbor retrovirus-related sequences.  Viral small RNA sequences are present in viral-related neoplasms such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma (EBV) and such exogenous RNA can be of biologic and diagnostic interest. Profiling of seminoma may identify novel miRNAs specific to prenatal germ cells and retrovirus-related small RNAs.
In summary, we aim to identify miRNA markers in the above neoplasms.  We plan to 1) evaluate microRNA expression via illumina sequencing and bioinformatic analysis, generating sequence-based miRNA expression profiles and 2) use RNA FISH to validate these markers and analyze their precise expression patterns within the tumors.

For Aim 1: 
•	We will identify FFPE sections from 10 cases each of: IPMN with low/intermediate-grade dyplasia, PanIN with low/intermediate grade dysplasia, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, pancreatic, ileal, and rectal ETs, seminoma and non-seminomatous germ cell tumors.  Eighty cases will be analyzed in total.
•	Total RNA will be extracted from FFPE tissues in the translational research facility.  MiRNA profiling will be carried out by Dr. Renwick at Rockefeller University.

For Aim 2:
•	If these studies identify promising miRNA targets, we will provide Dr. Renwick with FFPE tissue sections for in situ hybridization studies.  The number of unstained slides needed will be based upon the number of targets identified, and we estimate that 500 unstained slides or less will be needed.",5,"Nicole Panarelli","Admin Approved - RK - 04/25/2012",1,24-APR-12,"Project Budget

It improves patient outcomes. Trastuzumab is a standard component of HER2-positive breast cancer treatment. It is a broadly available and widely accepted HER2-targeted treatment.


Clinically 50-70% of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer patients demonstrate up front resistance or develop resistance to trastuzumab on treatment.  A dual irreversible EGFR/HER2 inhibitor like BIBW 2992 may provide a reasonable treatment alternative for patients failing on trastuzumab, as will be investigated in this study.

Frequently trastuzumab is continued beyond progression in patients who received some benefit from trastuzumab in an earlier line of treatment already in clinical practice, and only chemotherapy combination partners are changed. 

BIBW 2992 is a novel oral EGFR/HER2 inhibitor that offers the chance to control both recurrent as well as distant metastatic disease on an outpatient basis with continuous treatment.  

Objectives: 
This randomized, open label phase III trial will be performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer, who failed one prior trastuzumab treatment in the adjuvant or first line metastatic setting. The main objective of the trial is to show superior efficacy of BIBW 2992 in combination with vinorelbine (Arm A) over trastuzumab, which is continued beyond progression in combination with vinorelbine (Arm B) in first and second line metastatic breast cancer patients. If trial 1200.75 is positive it may offer a new efficacious and safe treatment alternative to HER2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancer patients failing trastuzumab treatment.

Determination of Sample Size:
It is estimated that approximately 975 patients will be screened for the trial in order to enroll 780 eligible patients. 349 to 484 PFS failures would be expected to provide 90% power for the log-rank test, presuming a hazard ratio of 0.70 to 0.7368 for BIBW 2992 relative to trastuzumab.",5,"solidtumor","Admin Approved - RK - 05/07/2012",1,27-APR-12,"Fresh tissue/tumor assessment is invoiceable.

In recent years, clinicians have incorporated gene expression profiling into the management of breast cancer patients in order to gain additional prognostic and predictive information that will aid in clinical decision making.  Multiple gene “signatures” are currently commercially available that give clinicians information about a patient’s risk of cancer recurrence and potential benefit from chemotherapy. 
Oncotype Dx® is a 21 gene RT-PCR assay that was developed for use with formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue. An algorithm based on the levels of specific genes that correlate with distant recurrence was developed and is used to calculate a recurrence score. This score, which is reported to clinicians, divides patients into three risk groups – low, intermediate, and high risk. For node-negative patients with ER-positive breast cancer, the risks of recurrence at 10 years in low and high risk groups are 6.8% and 30.5%, respectively.1 Patients in the low risk group are adequately treated by hormonal therapy alone, while patients in the high-risk group benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. Clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate the benefit, or lack thereof, of adding chemotherapy to hormonal therapy in patients in the intermediate risk group.2
BreastPRS, a 200 gene algorithm has recently been developed and validated based on genomic and clinical data from 477 breast cancer patients.3 This prognosis signature stratifies patients into risk groups with statistically and clinically differences in recurrence free and overall survival (RFS/OS). In untreated node-negative patients, 88% sensitivity and 44% specificity for 10 year RFS was observed, with a positive and negative predictive value of 32% and 92%, respectively, and high-risk patients appear to significantly benefit from chemotherapy. 
In our study, we plan to compare the BreastPRS Prognostic Index against the Oncotype Dx® Recurrence Score for the same breast cancer specimens from 300 patients. The relationship between prognosis scores from both BreastPRS and Oncotype Dx® with relevant clinicopathologic variables, molecular grade and intrinsic/molecular subtype of each tumor will be examined.

They consist of the estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptors, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). In patients who do not express these receptors (triple negative breast cancers), many of whom also harbor mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA), however, these traditional targets are not as helpful. The search therefore continues for more promising targets in these patient populations. An exciting new target is poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP). 
PARP is a family of extensively studied cellular enzymes which are involved in DNA damage repair pathways1. In particular, PARP is a part of the base excision repair pathway especially important in the repair of single strand DNA breaks1-2. This pathway important in the prevention of single stranded breaks which can then form highly unstable double strands and lead to further oncogenic instability1.  While DNA repair mechanisms are highly redundant, the large role that PARP plays makes it a potential target as both a prognostic indicator in tumor cells and a possible target for therapy, especially in BRCA mutation-positive patients who already have a defective DNA repair mechanism1,2.   The proposed mechanism for the therapeutic use of PARP inhibitors is the idea of “synthetic lethality,” a process by which the loss of 2 DNA repair gene functions promotes cellular apoptosis, while the loss of a single gene function does not1. PARP inhibitors therefore provide that second functional loss in tumor cells which would otherwise be able to repair DNA damage done by standard chemotherapeutic regimens1.
Studies have begun to evaluate the pattern of expression of PARP by immunohistochemistry in both BRCA carriers and, more broadly applicable, sporadic tumors which are demonstrated to be either negative for all three hormone receptors or those which over-express HER21-3. However, additional studies are needed to validate these initial findings. In breast carcinomas, cytoplasmic staining for PARP have been found to correlate with undifferentiated, node-positive, and non-lobular carcinomas. Cytoplasmic staining in these tumors also correlated with improved chemotherapy response rates. In contrast, nuclear PARP staining was not found to correlate with any of these features2. A study looking at PARP expression in pancreatic tumors showed the opposite: nuclear PARP expression was prognostic of increased survival while cytoplasmic staining showed no correlation3.
We propose to significantly contribute to the currently sparse body of knowledge on PARP expression by immunohistochemistry in breast carcinomas.  The location of staining (cytoplasmic vs nuclear) will be assessed in multiple cohorts of breast cancer patients (BRCA positive, molecular subtypes) and to assess PARP’s predictive or prognostic potential, these staining results will be further analyzed to identify any correlation with standard clinicopathologic features (age, tumor size, histologic type, lymphovascular invasion, hormone receptor status, axillary lymph node status, treatment and clinical outcome) in these patients. 
To this end, we propose staining tissue microarrays already constructed from past/current TRC projects, specifically, BRCA-positive breast cancer patients (project #14333 – to be constructed) as well as those containing each of the 5 breast molecular subtypes (CTMAs 46, 47, 65, 69, 70, 72, and 73).",12,"sjshin","Admin Approved - RK - 06/07/2012",1,22-MAY-12,"2 unstained slides from each TMA: $10 x 2 x 9 = $180

One of the advantages of a multiplex stain is that it allows for conservation of lesional tissue.  This will ensure that the focus of concern is present in the single section used for the multiplex immunostain but also theoretically leave more lesional tissue in the paraffin block which can be used for other diagnostic or prognostic studies.   At this time, our initial study of 147 cases of breast carcinoma Is has been provisionally accepted for publication in the American Journal of Clinical Pathology pending minor revisions.  
There are currently commercially available cocktail immunostains that either help differentiate between lobular and ductal lesions (E-cadherin + p120: LC/DC breast cocktail from Biocare) or in-situ and invasive (CK5 + p63 + CK8/18: Breast triple stain from Clarient).

It has been commonly accepted that the testicular atrophy in KS is secondary to loss of germ cells. However if one considers that men with Sertoli cell only syndrome lack germ cell as well but fail to develop such a dramatic atrophy during puberty our hypothesis assumes that testicular atrophy in men with Klinefelter syndrome is a result of progressive loss and apoptosis of Sertoli cells and not only germ cell loss.  It is believed that Sertoli cells are terminally differentiated cells. We believe that in KS they undergo mitotic divisions during puberty and errors in XXY ch. synapsis leads to induction of apoptosis and massive loss of Sertoli cells. We already showed reduction in number of Sertoli cells per tubule (H+E). In proposed project we will compare expression of Sertoli cell differentiation markers: vimentin, aromatase CYP-19, androgen receptor, WT-1, p27kip1, and AMH between men with SCO and KS.

Treatments include surgery, hormone therapy, radiation, and/or chemotherapy and can varies widely depending on the clinicopathologic characteristics of the cancer. Currently, one of the most challenging issue in the management of breast cancer is to determine the appropriate population of patients with early stage breast cancer (defined as estrogen-receptor positive, lymph node negative, HER-2-negative) who may or may not benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. Clinicians use risk stratification tools (guidelines from the NCCN, Adjuvant! Online, and St.Gallen expert criteria) which are largely based on clinicopathologic factors such as age, tumor size, cancer grade, ER-status, co-morbidities and menopausal status4.  However, these algorithms are ineffective in predicting distant recurrence rate and response rate to chemotherapy. The current NCCN guideline recommends adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with ER-positive, node-negative, and >1cm in tumor size.4 The result of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-20 study shows an overall improvement of disease free and overall survival in patients with early stage tumor of < 1cm in size, while some of those with >1cm tumor did not benefit.1 Despite using the current guidelines, it remains unclear which subset of patients will benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. 

In the recent years, several genomic tests have been developed to better address this question.   The most widely use genomic test is Oncotype-DX (Genomic Health, Inc) which consists of a 21-gene assay, designed to predict 10 year distant recurrent rate and response to adjuvant chemotherapy reported as a recurrence score (RS). Previous trials have shown that patients with a low RS had minimal benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy whereas those with a high RS were much more likely to benefit from chemotherapy.1, 2, 3 Oncotype-DX has become a popular tool among oncologists in the clinical management of their early stage breast cancer patients. However, the cost-benefit of the assay has been questioned by some critics and therefore, this test has not yet become the standard of care. To our knowledge only two previous studies, consist a total of 85 and 89 patients, have examined whether Oncotype-DX influence the way patients are being treated. One of the study consists of a survey to the medical oncologists and therefore did not measure the actual clinical impact that the assay may or may not provide.1, 3

We set out to determine the true clinical impact of the Oncotype-DX assay on the decision of management of early stage breast cancer patients at New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center.  Secondly, we will strive to determine which subset of early stage breast cancer patients would most likely have an RS that would ultimately result in altering the management when comparing to the current guidelines.  Lastly, to develop a cost-effective algorithm to categorize which patients would most likely benefit from having an Oncotype-DX assay in conjunction with the standard clinicopathologic characterization.",5,"sjshin","Admin Approved - RK - 06/13/2012",1,05-JUN-12,"No resources other than biostatistical support is needed for this study.",0,3,"sjshin@med.cornell.edu","Sandra Shin","SJS",1,"The association between RS scores and categorical aspects of patients will be tested by Chi-square or Fisher's exact test.

Targeted biopsies of the gastric mucosa in the antrum or body or immediately adjacent to the malignancy will be obtained using the Bard Precisor EXL coated disposable biopsy forceps.

It is well known that the number of megakaryocytes is normal or increased and the levels of TPO are similar to healthy controls. The impaired platelet production may be due to increased megakaryocyte apoptosis in ITP. One study showed that  78% of ITP megakaryocytes showed evidence of apoptosis by electron microscopy and 28% had expression of activated caspase-3 by immunohistochemistry.  In addition, cytokine profiles show increased Th1 cytokine response. The CD8+ T-cells have an increased expression of cytotoxic molecules  and were shown to cause platelet lysis in the absence of autoantibodies  in ITP patients and induce severe ITP in mice. A decreased number or impaired T regs  also contribute to CD8+ T-cells cytotoxicity and development of ITP. TPO inhibits megakaryocyte apoptosis, which may explain the success of  TPO agents. However, a subset of ITP patients do not respond to TPO agents. We wanted to study the mechanism of decreased or absent response to TPO agents in patients with ITP. This study is done in collaboration with Dr. James Bussel, who is a leading clinician and researcher in the field of ITP.

Others have obtained myeloid conversion of B cells (with retention of IgH gene rearrangement) by enforcing expression of myeloid/macrophage master regulators (C/EBP and PU.1), leading to inactivation of Pax-5, a transcription factor associated with the B-cell lineage. In addition,  transdifferentiation rarely  occurs during evolution of B-cell malignancies in humans. Thus, there are reports of follicular lymphoma which transdifferentiated into clonally related histiocytic/dendritic cell sarcoma with absent Pax-5, as well as of CLL/SLL patients with clonally related interdigitating dendritic cell sarcoma with very weak Pax-5 expression. 
Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is the most common neoplasm associated with KSHV. Gene expression profiling studies have shown that KSHV infects B lymphocytes and lymphatic and vascular endothelial cells.

The study is being done because currently available treatment is not effective in curing patients with this type of leukemia. 

There are three parts to the treatment in this study. The first part of the study regimen will test the safety and effectiveness of adding dasatinib to the standard combination of chemotherapy drugs used to treat AML that include daunorubicin and cytarabine. The second part of the study regimen will test the safety and effectiveness of combining dasatinib with another chemotherapy treatment, consolidation therapy with high-dose cytarabine. Finally, the third part of the study regimen will test the effectiveness of the use of dasatinib alone for 12 months during continuation therapy. 

Subjects will receive study drug for about 18 months on study.

AML is a molecularly heterogeneous disease. It is becoming increasingly clear that patients with different molecular abnormalities have different treatment options and adaptations of standard chemotherapy regimens may benefit specific subgroups of patients. Although patients with core-binding factor mutations have a relatively favorable prognosis, only 50-60% have long-term survival with current chemotherapy.

Subjects will receive either 500 mg or 1000 mg of the study drug via infusion on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 during the first 4 weeks of treatment (induction therapy).

In addition to gene amplification, overexpression of CUL4A also has been documented in human primary breast cancers (Chen et al., 1998).  Recently, CUL4A was defined as a direct transcriptional target of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway (Miranda-Carboni et al., 2008), which partially accounts for high-level CUL4A expression.  We have shown that TNBC cell lines are addicted to high levels of CUL4A, as depletion of CUL4A by shRNA led to rapid growth suppression and induction of apoptosis (Liu and Zhou, unpublished).  In an effort to determine which substrate(s) of the CUL4A ubiquitin ligase is responsible for tumor maintenance, we measured cellular levels of known CUL4A substrates in the MMTV-Wnt1 mouse mammary tumors that induce high levels of CUL4A expression.  We identified the Set8 histone H4-K20 methyltransferase that was consistently downregulated (Liu and Zhou, unpublished).
Set8 (also known as SETD8, PR-Set7, Set07 or KMT5A) is a protein-lysine N-methyltransferase that monomethylates both histones and non-histone.  It specifically catalyzes monomethylation of histone H4 at lysine 20, thereby facilitating chromosomal condensation prior to segregation during mitosis.  Set8 was also shown to play a role in transcriptional regulation of Wnt target genes (Li et al., 2011), and was reported dysregulated in metastatic breast cancer (Yang et al., 2011).  Recently, Set8 was shown as a direct substrate of the CUL4-based ubiquitin ligase (Abbas et al., 2010; Centore et al., 2010).  Our finding that Set8 is selectively downregulated in murine MMTV-Wnt1 tumor model suggests that high levels of CUL4A may lead to excessive Set8 destruction, thereby interfering with chromosomal condensation.  As a result, sister chromatides are more susceptible to breakage when they are subjected to the mechanic forces from microtubules to pull them apart during mitosis, a major underlying mechanism for genomic instability and tumorigenesis.  Moreover, reduced Set8 levels may also affect gene expression and impact on tumorigenic events.

Similar differential efficacy was identified in exploratory analyses of phase III studies involving taxanes and antiangiogenic therapy.

Panobinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using letrozole may fight breast cancer by lowering the amount of estrogen the body makes. Giving panobinostat together with letrozole may be an effective treatment for breast cancer.

These tumors tend to recur after initial treatment and also have shown a high degree of resistance to standard chemotherapy. Predictive biomarkers in targeted cancer therapy are major enablers of successful invention of therapeutics. The recent identification of extreme PARP inhibitor responsiveness in homologous recombination (HR) deficient BrCA mutant tumors is a notable recent example of such a biomarker (2,3). TNBC present a high degree of genomic instability and commonly harbor p53 tumor suppressor gene mutations (4). In the course of identification of p53 responsive targets that are altered in response to increased genomic instability, we identified several novel genes including ZNF365. Our preliminary analysis has shown that decreased ZNF365 expression leads to high basal levels of chromosomal instability, defective HR, and most importantly increased sensitivity to gamma irradiation and PARP inhibition.  Given ZNF365’s activity on major DNA repair mechanisms of HR, induction of ZNF365 by p53 under DNA damage in part account for the tumor suppressor activity of this pathway. Of note, recent genome wide association studies identified a specific SNP within ZNF365 locus for breast cancer susceptibility suggesting its potential role in breast tumorigenesis (5,6). Furthermore, publicly available cancer datasets show overall decreased expression of ZNF365 in TNBC (7). In light of these data, the goal of this project is to investigate the expression pattern of ZNF365 in breast cancer, in particular TNBC. We propose to use previously constructed CTMAs #46 and #47 consisting of approximately 200 invasive TNBC and #69 and #70 as luminal type A non-TNBC controls from 158 cases.

To maintain the survival and growth of tumor cells under the harsh intra- and extra-cellular microenvironment, a set of adaptive response pathways are induced to help the cell to cope with the stress. Unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway is one of the protective downstream responses, which is triggered by
the alteration of the physiological environment of Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). ER stress is induced by changes in glycosylation, redox status, glucose availability, calcium homeostasis and accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins at the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER). UPR serves to protect the ER by inducing chaperons, blocking translation and increasing protein folding, or induces cell death with persistent ER stress. In mammalian cells, UPR is mediated by three ER-localized transmembrane proteins acting as sensors: Inositol-requiring transmembrane kinase/endonuclease-1 (IRE1), PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). UPR is activated in several human cancers, however, the role of UPR is breast cancer is largely unknown. The objective of this study is to delineate the role of target genes in UPR pathway in the breast tumor progression.

The goal of therapy for these patients is, therefore, to modify the natural history of the disease and extend the survival and time to AML transformation. With the exception of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT), for which most patients are unsuitable due to their age, there is currently no curative treatment for MDS, and older patients, who comprise the majority of those affected, generally receive supportive care, low dose chemotherapy, or investigational treatments. The association between MDS and AML has long been recognized. 

Median survival for untreated AML is less than 3 months. A diagnosis of AML necessitates a rapid assessment and planning. The goal of therapy is to achieve as quickly as possible a complete and prolonged remission, perhaps resulting in a cure. Therapy for good risk patients is generally an induction therapy with a single or combination of chemotherapeutic agents, usually high-dose or standard dose cytarabine with or without an anthracycline and/or mitoxantrone and/or etoposide. If a complete remission is achieved, a bone marrow transplant or consolidation therapy is undertaken. Patients who are refractory to this therapy or who relapse within 1 year or who are considered high risk for intensive chemotherapy (one or more of the following: &#8805; 65 years, not having one of the good-risk cytogenetic abnormalities, and are unable or unwilling to undergo intensive chemotherapy) have few treatment options and as a result the prognosis for these patients is particularly poor. Median survival for these patients is 6 months or less. 

There are currently two FDA-approved DNMT inhibitors for the treatment of MDS; these are the nucleoside analogs azacitidine and 2’-deoxy-5-azacytidine, or decitabine. These drugs reverse aberrant hypermethylation. Several studies established the efficacy of decitabine in MDS subjects with 2 approved regimens. The 20 mg/m2 per day administered intravenously for 5 days appear to be better tolerated with less myelosuppression. 

The active metabolite of SGI-110 (2’-deoxy-5-azacytidylyl-(3’&#8594;5’)-2’-deoxyguanosine sodium salt), a dinucleotide, is decitabine. SGI-110 is resistant to modification by cytidine deaminase, a common pathway of decitabine metabolism and deactivation. In xenograft studies, SGI-110 demonstrates promising preclinical activity in both hematologic and solid tumors.   In vitro evidence suggests that SGI-110 has a longer half-life than decitabine in the presence of cytidine deaminase. Exploratory preclinical studies demonstrate that unlike decitabine, SGI-110 can suppress the polycomb repressor complex 2 which is involved in silencing tumor suppressor genes. These promising observations suggest that SGI-110 has improved pharmaceutical properties and biological activities that expand on decitabine’s current clinical utility. SGI-110 has shown to be better tolerated in mice than decitabine and is as effective in vivo in inducing p16 expression, reducing DNA methylation at the p16 promotor region, and retarding EJ6 human bladder cancer tumor growth in athymic mice.",5,"leukemia","Admin Approved - RK - 05/07/2012",1,18-APR-12,"$22 for Iron stained slide

In two pilot projects, we have identified recurrent NCOA2 gene rearrangements in congenital/infantile spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma (Mosquera JM, Sboner A, et al, Genes Chromosomes Cancer 2013, in press), and recurrent NOTCH family gene rearrangements in benign and malignant glomus tumors (Mosquera JM, Sboner A, et al, in preparation).

Application of these technologies to identify novel gene fusions in sarcomas will provide an unprecedented opportunity to exploit integration analysis with other tumor types, and to define new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, as well as novel therapeutic targets. 

We have assembled a highly collaborative multidisciplinary team including experts in pathology, computational biomedicine, and cancer genomics. We envision that during the course of this ambitious project, we will characterize disease-defining gene fusions in other sarcoma subsets, which will have significant clinical impact (e.g. novel gene targets).

The target is proNGF, a secreted protein hypothesized to be a key actor in this pathway.  

ProNGF is normally cleaved intracellularly to produce mature nerve growth factor (NGF).  Secreted NGF activates the TrkA receptor tyrosine kinase to promote survival.  Beyond functioning as the precursor to NGF, proNGF itself has been identified as an independent ligand that potently mediates apoptosis of neurons and vascular smooth muscle cells by activating a coreceptor complex of p75, a member of the TNF receptor superfamily, and sortilin/SorCS2, a sortilin family member. 

Under normal circumstances, proNGF is at low or undetectable levels in adult tissues.  However, proNGF is an inducible cytokine.  After cardiac ischemic/reperfusion (I/R) injury in rodents and dogs, NGF isoforms are induced by six hours, and in rodents NGF isoforms remain elevated for two weeks before returning to baseline.  The goal of this study is to determine the expression of proNGF and its receptors in human autopsy specimens from patients with myocardial infarcts compared to autopsy specimens from those without heart disease.

In order to do this we would like to examine the following number of cases:

40 cases with myocardial infarct:
 2 blocks per case = 80 blocks
 10 unstained slides for each block = 800 slides

5 cases without myocardial infarct:
 2 blocks per case = 10 blocks
 10 unstained slides for each block = 100

This number of cases should be adequate to determine the association of proNGF with injured myocardium.

Most commonly, the area where the prostate was originally located before being removed (prostate bed) is treated, without treating the lymph nodes where cancer can spread. There is some evidence in men who have not had surgery that radiotherapy to the pelvic lymph nodes may stop the cancer from spreading under some conditions. Since treating the pelvic lymph nodes can result in increased side effects, the benefit of this method of radiation therapy needs to be tested.
Prostate cancer feeds on male hormones, such as testosterone. Drugs that reduce or block testosterone (hormone therapy) can cause some prostate cancer cells to die and others to become sick so that they don’t grow. Some subjects treated with a combination of these drugs and radiation have a greater chance of not having the cancer return when compared to men treated with radiation alone.

Though there is no clear standard of care, first-line treatment of incurable SCCHN typically includes single agent cisplatin or carboplatin, or a chemotherapy doublet that combines a platinum agent with either a taxane or 5-fluorouracil. Unfortunately, the regimens used in this setting have very limited activity, with response rates for single-agent and combination chemotherapy typically less than 15% and 30%, and median survival of 5 to 10 months respectively.  
For patients who have failed first-line systemic therapy, a variety of single agent chemotherapies may be used, including cetuximab, gemcitabine and methotrexate. In a single-arm study in SCCHN patients who had failed prior platinum-based chemotherapy, 13% of patients achieved partial response (PR) with cetuximab therapy, and median overall survival (OS) was approximately 6 months.  Cetuximab is the only agent with FDA approval for second-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer after platinum based therapy.  Given the extremely limited treatment options in this setting, there is tremendous unmet need for novel agents. 
In pharmacology studies, ACE-041 has demonstrated significant anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor activity.

The pre-transplant conditioning regimen is used to prepare a subject for transplantation (a procedure in which a person receives blood stem cells, which make any type of blood cell). A conditioning regimen may include chemotherapy, monoclonal antibody therapy, and radiation to the entire body. It helps make room in the subject’s bone marrow for new blood stem cells to grow, helps prevent the subject's body from rejecting the transplanted cells, and helps kill any cancer cells that are in the body.  Lymphoma is a type of cancer that begins in cells of the immune system.  Both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) can occur in children and adults, and prognosis and treatment depend on the stage and the type of cancer.

Many genes and ultimately protein expression effect response to chemotherapy.  Being able to better predict likelihood of pathological complete response (pCR) or substantial decrease in residual cancer burden (RCB) of chemotherapy regimens given specific biomarker expression patterns would better help clinicians guide treatment stategies.  

Chemoresistance may be mediated by a number of different mechanisms including detoxification of chemotherapy agents, preventing chemotherapy induced apoptosis, or altering cell cycle pathways induced by DNA damage.  In this study, we have selected specific gene and resulting biomarker expression that have been shown in preliminary published studies to have predictive value, specifically, 14-3-3&#963;, aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH1A1), glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1), p53, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), and RAF-1.  14-3-3&#963;, or stratifin is a tumor suppressor gene which is induced by p53 when DNA damage occurs.  14-3-3&#963; loss has been shown to have a significant negative association in pCR in breast cancer (1).  ALDH1A1 is a detoxifying enzyme which has been shown to inactivate specific chemotherapy agents and its expression has been shown to correlate with minimal or no response to chemotherapy (2).  GSTP1 expression has been shown to be associated with chemoresistance in breast cancer through its ability to detoxify chemotherapy agents and prevent chemotherapy induced apoptosis (3).   Mutations in p53 are among the most common genetic alterations in breast cancer and have been implicated in both radio-and chemoresistance in breast cancers via inability to trigger p53 induced apoptosis (4).  Tumor hypoxia has also been implicated as a tumor characteristic associated with radioresistance in breast cancer.  VEGF and HIF-1 have been linked to increased tumor angiogenesis (5-8).  Raf-1, a serine/theonine kinase, plays a role in apoptotic pathways14 15 16 and upregulation of Raf-1 leads has been implicated in chemotherapy resistance though to be driven through divergent responses to cell growth and apoptosis(1,7).   These proteins has been found to be upregulated under hypoxic conditions and implicated to be associated with radio- and chemoresistance5 (6,9,10).   

Furthermore, the status of standard biomarkers utilized in breast cancer treatment [i.e. estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), Ki-67] may play a role in response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  Additionally, in some studies, NAC has been found to induce alterations in immunoreactivity of ER, PR and HER2 in breast cancer (11,12), however there are conflicting reports that they remain unaltered following chemotherapy (13).  Given the importance of these biomarkers in influencing clinical decision of adjuvant molecular and hormonal therapy after NAC, further studies are needed to evaluate these observations. 

Approximately 100-110 cases in TMA format will be evaluated with the above immunostains with the exception of Ki-67 which will be evaluated on whole tissue sections.  We will also correlate expression of these proteins with neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen and clinicopathologic parameters, including age, menopausal status, tumor size, nodal involvement, tumor grade, biomarker status, and, if possible, patient outcomes.",5,"sjshin","Admin Approved - RK - 07/12/2012",1,07-JUL-12,"100 blocks x 3 cores/block x $5/core = $1500

Step 2: The purpose of Step 2 is to determine the effectiveness of continuing treatment after Step 1 with lenalidomide plus rituximab, compared to continuing with rituximab alone.
Study participants will be randomly assigned to one of four treatment regimens:
•	Group 1: Step 1 rituximab plus bendamustine, followed by Step 2 rituximab for up to 2 years
•	Group 2: Step 1 bortezomib plus rituximab and bendamustine, followed by Step 2 rituximab for up to 2 years
•	Group 3: Step 1 rituximab plus bendamustine, followed by Step 2 lenalidomide plus rituximab for up to 2 years
•	Group 4: Step 1 bortezomib plus rituximab and bendamustine, followed by Step 2 lenalidomide plus rituximab for up to 2 years
Although each of the drugs used in the study are FDA-approved to treat blood cancers, the combinations used in this study have not been FDA-approved and are considered experimental.
Participants will be asked to take 6 cycles (6 months) of chemotherapy in Step 1. Participants in Groups 1 and 2 will take rituximab every 8 weeks for 2 years. Participants in Groups 3 and 4 will take 24 cycles (2 years) of lenalidomide plus rituximab.

However, more recent molecular based studies have confirmed that LCIS is, indeed, a non-obligate precursor to invasive carcinoma.  It has been also recently discovered that several variants of LCIS exist.  One such variant has been termed ""pleomorphic type"" and patients with this variant appear to experience a more biologically more aggressive clinical course akin to those with ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS).  Consequently, there has been an attempt by practicing pathologists to differentiate between the pleomorphic and classical types of LCIS.  Unfortunately, the main determinant is the difference in nuclear size and degree of pleomorphism, the assessment of which can be subjective and poorly reproducible.  A more subtle difference between the two types is the mitotic activity which may or may not be appreciated in all cases with routine microscopic evaluation. Phosphorylation of histone H3 has been found to be highly associated with mitotic chromatin condensation.  Moreover, immunostaining of PPH3 has been shown to be correlative with mitotic activity in multiple organs.  PPH3 is specific for cells in the late G2 or M phases of the cell cycle and could potentially be a more sensitive/specific marker for mitotic activity than microscopic assessment alone.  We propose to perform an initial pilot study of 10 cases (5 classical, 5 pleomorphic) to see if there is a difference in % positive cells.

The mitotic rate in stromal cells is an important histologic parameter in the evaluation and classification of FETs. Fibroadenomas have no or rare mitoses, while phyllodes tumors are characterized as benign (0-2 mitoses per 10 high-power fields (hpf)), borderline (3-5 mitoses per 10 hpf), or malignant (>5 per 10 hpf). Mitotic activity is routinely assessed on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained slides. The practice of counting mitotic figures can be subjective and time consuming. Furthermore, identifying mitotic figures in a “condensed” state, which can occur with hypoxia, inadequate fixation, or a delay in fixation, may be difficult. 1 
Ki-67 staining has been shown to be of limited clinical utility and is not routinely employed in the evaluation of FETs.2,3 Ki-67 is expressed in cells throughout the cell cycle and Ki-67-labeled nuclei may not survive the cell cycle and proceed to apoptosis.1 Phosphorylation of histone H3 is highly associated with mitotic chromatin condensation.4,5 Immunohistochemical staining of phosphohistone H3 (PPH3) has been shown to be correlative with mitotic activity in multiple organs.1,6-11 PPH3 is specific for cells in late G2 or M phases of the cell cycle and will not stain necrotic or apoptotic cells, potential histologic mimics of mitotic figures.5 PPH3 is highly sensitive for detecting cells in mitosis and allows reliable identification of prophase nuclei, which may not be readily identified on H&E.4 
The goal of this study is to determine the utility of PPH3 as an adjunct or surrogate marker for assessing proliferative activity in FETs of the breast. We plan to compare H&E-determined stromal cell mitotic counts with those determined using PPH3 and Ki-67 in a series of FETs. The study will include 25 fibroadenomas, 25 benign phyllodes tumors, and 25 borderline phyllodes tumors, all diagnosed on excision. For benign and borderline phyllodes tumors, a section from the prior needle core biopsy, if available, will also be stained with these markers. For each tumor, 4 sets of 10 consecutive hpfs will be examined. The number of stromal cell mitoses identified (H&E) and the number mitoses or nuclei stained (PPH3 and Ki-67) per 10 hpfs will be assessed. In addition, staining will be evaluated by automated digital image analysis using the freely available ImageJ DIA program (NIH, Washington; http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/).
We plan to determine the correlation between mitotic rates assessed by PPH3 with those determined by manual H&E counting. We will also compare manual PPH3 evaluation with automated image analysis. We will observe whether changes are made in the classification of tumors in the study using PPH3 as the sole determinant of mitotic activity.

The overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 members (including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, etc.) in various types of cancer has made them therapeutic targets. The anti-apoptotic proteins contain a hydrophobic groove that binds to the pro-apoptotic proteins, Bak and Bax, which are responsible for mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). Bax and Bak generally are held in check by the anti-apoptotic proteins. In response to apoptotic stimuli, the third Bcl-2 subfamily, BH3-only proteins, promote apoptosis by either activating Bax and Bak or inactivating the anti-apoptotic proteins. Subsequently, Bak and Bax are recruited to MOM where they oligomerize and cause MOMP, releasing pro-apoptotic effectors such as cytochrome c to activate caspases, ultimately resulting in cell death.

Small molecules have been developed to inhibit Bcl-2/Bcl-xL anti-apoptotic function. However, the therapeutic effect of these inhibitors is often limited even for tumors with Bcl-2/Bcl-xL overexpression. This may be in part due to other oncogenic functions of Bcl-2 members in addition to anti-apoptosis.

Recently, we have identified a novel nuclear function of Bcl-xL in promoting invasion and metastasis without changing apoptotic rates of tumor cells. We hypothesize that metastatic tumors have lower expression of Bax and Bak to interact Bcl-xL on the mitochondria; therefore Bcl-xL can translocate into nucleus. To test our hypothesis, we propose to stain stage IV lung cancer specimens with pro-apoptotic proteins, anti-apoptotic proteins by immunohistochemistry.",5,"NancyDu","Admin Approved - BH 03/17/14",1,26-FEB-14,"The project will use ~40 cases of metastatic lung carcinoma to stain 5 antibodies.

KS is difficult to distinguish from other angioproliferative diseases, particularly in Africa where access to trained pathologists is limited to a few hospitals and immunohistochemistry is practically non-existent.  Multiple studies have shown that PCR based nucleic acid identification of Kaposi?s sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) in skin biopsies represents the best method of performing an unambiguous diagnosis in the absence of immunohistochemistry.  Biopsy based nucleic acid screening presents a number of challenges that cannot be addressed by existing detection technologies in limited resource settings.  First, a field nurse must be able to extract the sample from the patient and process it in such a way so as to release the DNA without the use of traditional laboratory equipment like centrifuges.  Secondly the amplification reaction must be carried out in an energy efficient way so that the amount of energy that can be stored in reasonably portable batteries does not significantly limit the number of tests that can be conducted.  This is particularly important in places like Uganda where only a small fraction of the population has access to electricity and the supply is irregular even in large cities.  Finally the results need to be interpreted in a quantitative fashion (beyond what can be done with the naked eye) without the need to engineer further specialized equipment.  Ideally this system could also archive, transmit, and geo-locate the test and results to facilitate population level scientific studies. We are developing a KS-Detect system that can address many of these challenges.  The system will include a simplified low-cost DNA extraction method that does not require any specialized equipment or refrigeration of reagents. DNA will be PCR-amplified using a novel smartphone-assisted solar-thermal PCR for extremely low-power nucleic acid amplification, and a fluorescence or nanoparticle based colorimetric smartphone assay for the quantification of the results.  The system is designed to be used by a field nurse, and addresses a number of challenges with low resource setting diagnosis of Kaposi?s sarcoma including: the ability to take and process a biopsy samples in the field, providing at least a 10-fold increase in the number of diagnostic reactions that can be performed on a single battery charge by using sunlight to drive the thermal cycling process, and elimination of the reliance on specialized instrumentation enabling the system to be fixed in the field.

Front-line regimens consist of chemoimmunotherapy. While the response rates with these types of regimens are typically high, patients inevitably relapse and further treatment options are necessary. Traditional chemotherapy is associated with significant toxicity; therefore targeted therapy is favored to improve upon efficacy as well as tolerability.

Lenalidomide is a novel immunomodulatory agent that has been approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic syndromes with del 5q and is currently undergoing evaluation in non-Hodgkin?s lymphoma (NHL). In a phase II study, Witzig et al treated 43 patients with relapsed or refractory indolent NHL with lenalidomide 25 mg daily on Days 1-21, every 4 weeks, for up to a year. Of the 22 patients with follicular lymphoma, six had a response, two of which were complete. The median duration of response had not been reached, but was estimated to be longer than 16.5 months. 
When combined with rituximab in the front-line setting for indolent B-cell NHL, lenalidomide produced an ORR of 90% with 66% CR. Among the patients with follicular lymphoma, an impressive 87% achieved CR. The regimen was tolerable; common toxicities included rash, neutropenia, and myalgias. A phase II CALGB trial (50803) of lenalidomide and rituximab in previously untreated follicular lymphoma has recently completed accrual and preliminary results suggest both tolerability and efficacy.


In order to further expand upon both rate and durability of response previously achieved in follicular lymphoma, we propose a combination of rituximab, lenalidomide, and ibrutinib. By targeting NF-&#954;B through multiple pathways, we believe this regimen will produce superior antitumor efficacy. Based on the preliminary data from our 50803 trial, we have designed a phase I study to further evaluate this three-drug combination as front-line treatment for follicular lymphoma. By providing multi-targeted therapy, we hope to improve upon the survival of this incurable disease as well postpone the need for aggressive chemotherapy and its associated toxicities. The data from this trial, as well as the CALGB 50803 trial, will be incorporated into the design of a multi-arm phase III Alliance trial evaluating the rituximab and lenalidomide backbone in combination with novel small molecule targeted agents in previously untreated follicular lymphoma.",5,"dab2054","",1,31-OCT-13,"N/A",150,2,"pem9019@med.cornell.edu","Peter Martin","PM",0,"",,,,,,""

While treatment options have long included chemotherapy and radiation treatment, improvements in overall survival were not demonstrated despite many efforts over several decades. 

More effective treatment options are needed for patients with recurrent follicular lymphoma, which is largely incurable. Combinations of novel treatment agents as outlined here offer the potential to overcome resistance to chemotherapy and/or rituximab, and may ultimately lead to overall or progression-free survival benefits. The safety profiles of the agents appear to compare favorably to standard approaches in relapsed/refractory disease, which include chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation. A well-tolerated regimen that can provide durable remissions would be expected to enhance quality of life. A combination treatment strategy that proves effective and tolerable in relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma would merit consideration for evaluation as an initial treatment approach in future studies, and may also warrant evaluation in other lymphoma subtypes and settings. 

We hypothesize that the addition of the PI3K inhibitor idelalisib to lenalidomide plus rituximab will be well tolerated in patients with recurrent follicular lymphoma. In this population, we will establish the dosing, safety and preliminary activity of the three-drug (idelalisib, lenalidomide, and rituximab) combination, hypothesizing that it will be sufficiently promising to warrant a follow-up randomized phase II/III trial (vs. lenalidomide plus rituximab or another standard regimen).

Similarly, a study found a 34 to 48-fold increased association of CLL/SLL in MCC patients relative to the general US population [2].  Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this association, including compromised immune functions in CLL/SLL patients and presence of Merkel cell polyoma virus in CLL/SLL. Interestingly, some researchers hypothesized that MCCs may be derived from pro- or pre-B cells, because expression of the B cell markers like PAX5, TdT, IgG, IgM and IgA has been reported in the majority of MCCs [3].  Recently we have also identified an intriguing case in which identical monoclonal immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) gene rearrangements were detected in MCC and CLL/SLL of the same patient, suggesting that these two neoplasms are clonally related.
 
The goal of the study is to further investigate the possibility of B-cell ancestry in CLL and clonal relationship between paired CLL/SLL and MCC. We plan to perform a retrospective study which includes 47 MCC cases (4 of them have known history of CLL/SLL), diagnosed between January 2000 and June 2014. All patients' slides will be retrieved from the files and reevaluated. A tissue microarray block will be prepared for immunostaining with PAX5, TdT, IgG, IgM and IgA. Additionally, an extra 2 cores will be taken from a representative block of each case for DNA extraction and gene rearrangement analysis. If necessary, a laser assisted microdissection will be performed to isolate the MCC and CLL/SLL components for composite tumors.

Our proposal seeks to confirm that regions of coronary artery with F18-NaF activity of associated with histological features of plaque likely to undergo surface disruption and lead to an AMI.

These polyps frequently show molecular features of MSI-H adenocarcinomas, including BRAF mutations and loss of immunohistochemical staining for MLH1.  They also express Annexin A10, a recently described marker of the serrated neoplastic pathway.  In contrast, microsatellite stable (MSS) colonic adenocarcinomas presumably arise from conventional adenomas via the chromosomal instability pathway, which relies on Wnt signaling activation.  Thus, conventional adenomas tend to show molecular alterations associated with chromosomal instability, such as mutations in KRAS and nuclear localization of B-catenin.  Wnt signaling and MSI-H are generally considered to be mutually exclusive cancer progression models.  Some recent studies suggest that sessile serrated polyps with and without dysplasia harbor molecular alterations associated with both the serrated neoplastic and chromosomal instability pathways.  For example, we and others have observed nuclear localization of B-catenin in sessile serrated polyps with dysplasia.  We also note that dysplastic foci in sessile serrated polyps show morphologic features of either conventional adenomas or serrated dysplasia.  The purpose of this study is to evaluate immunohistochemical and molecular features of the chromosomal instability and serrated neoplastic pathways in a series of sessile serrated polyps with and without dysplasia and to correlate our findings with morphologic features of these polyps.
In order to do this we will:
1.	Identify 60 sessile serrated polyps from a search of the pathology database
2.	Classify polyps into one of the following four categories
   a.	Negative for dysplasia
   b.	Positive for dysplasia ? conventional adenoma-type
   c.	Positive for dysplasia ? serrated-type
   d.	Positive for dysplasia ? mixed type

They may be classified as benign tumors (Spitz nevi), malignant tumors (spitzoid melanomas) and tumors with borderline histopathological features and uncertain clinical outcome (atypical spitz tumors). Since spitz nevi, commonly exhibit morphologic features that often mimic melanomas molecular characterization may be helpful in delineating different genomic signatures in spitzoid neoplasms. Recent advances in molecular pathology have identified HRAS mutations or concomitant presence of BRAF V600E and BAP1 mutations in subsets of spitzoid neoplasms whereas melanomas arising from congenital nevi appear to be NRAS-driven. . Furthermore, it has been recently recognized that spitzoid melanomas may have various kinase fusions that involve ALK, BRAF, NTRK, and ROS genes. We will use targeted Next generation Sequencing (NGS) to understand the molecular landscape of adult Spitzoid neoplasms for improved histological classification and a better genotype-phenotype correlation.

Akt kinases are activated by PI3 kinase pathway. Activated Akt has been shown to interact with ER&#945; and androgen receptor, and so intuitively would seem to play a role in breast and prostate cancers among others1. A study by Nakatani et al. showed that Akt3 expression was significantly increased in ER negative breast cancer cell lines at both enzymatic and mRNA levels 2.  Kirkegaard et al. also found Akt 3 to be amplified by FISH in a subset of 10% of ER positive tumors 3.  Akt3 has not been widely studied in breast cancers and the mechanisms of its activation in breast cancer are just beginning to emerge. Recently, Banerji et al. described an in-frame fusion rearrangement of MAGI3 (on chromosome 1p) and AKT3 (on chromosome 1q) in triple negative breast cancer 4. This gene fusion was found through next generation sequencing and validated only at the transcript level through polymerase chain reaction. They conducted functional studies and showed that this rearrangement constitutively activates MAGI3-AKT3 kinase and its downstream pathways. Blocking of Akt kinase by a competitive small molecule inhibitor (GSK-690693) inhibited the downstream activation. Triple negative (ER/PR/HER-2/neu negative) breast cancer is known to be highly aggressive and resistant to conventional chemotherapeutic treatment for breast cancer. Therefore, confirming that MAGI3-AKT3 fusion is a recurrent event in breast cancer would have significant clinical impact since patients may benefit from newer treatment modalities like Akt kinase inhibitors. We have developed break-apart fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) assays for both MAGI3 and AKT3 (RubinLab), to interrogate our own cohort of 166 triple negative breast cancers. We will also interrogate these cases with RT-PCR, using the published sequences by Banerji et al. In that study 4 patient populations were Mexican and Vietnamese. It will then be relevant to evaluate the presence of MAGI3-AKT3 fusion in a more diverse patient population.
Aim:
Using FISH and RT-PCR, we will interrogate for the presence of MAGI3-AKT3 gene fusion rearrangement a cohort 166 patients with triple negative breast cancer.  These patients? tissues are already in the form of a tissue microarray (CTMAs 46, 47) and are ready to use.  If necessary, these assays will be performed on other breast cancer cohorts and on additional TMAs representing the other molecular subtypes of breast cancer (CTMA 65, 69, 70, 72, 73) to determine the incidence of this rearrangement in triple negative breast cancer patients when compared to other subtypes.

However, given the inability to accurately determine which patients will respond to medical management most ultimately undergo hysterectomy for definitive treatment.  Forkhead transcription factor, FOXO1, belongs to a family of transcription factors downstream of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.  FOXO1 proteins ensure normal homeostasis in the endometrium by regulating cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis and recent data suggests that its regulation may be controlled by progesterone.Under normal circumstances, in the presence of progesterone,FOXO1 is unphosphorylated and expression is limited to the nucleus.  We, and others, have shown that nuclear FOXO1 expression is lost in endometrioid carcinoma. This loss in function appears to be the result of phosphorylation throughthe PI3K/Akt signaling pathwayresulting in translocation to the cytoplasm.

Aim:  To determine if FOXO1 nuclear expression is restored by high dose progestin therapy in women with complex atypical hyperplasia and/or well-differentiated endometrioid carcinoma.  With this study we aim to review a subset of younger patients diagnosed with complex atypical hyperplasia and/or well-differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma to evaluate FOXO1 expression following progesterone therapy and determine if it correlates with response to progestin therapy.

Methods: We will retrospectively review 20 - 30 cases of complex atypical hyperplasia and/or well-differentiated adenocarcinoma diagnosed in patients < 40 years of age who elected to preserve fertility and receive progesterone therapy.

Background: Approximately 10-15% of all allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants in adults are complicated by development of a series of laboratory and clinical signs and symptoms that are consistent with diagnosis of a thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). However, the treatment of these disorders is unclear and the mortality rate is high because it is often difficult to distinguish between the two major types of TMA, TTP (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura) and aHUS (atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome), as well as between a TMA and complications of the transplant itself and the immune suppressive drugs used in support of the allo transplant. These are critical distinctions because the therapies are very different: plasma exchange for a TTP-like TMA; eculizumab (anti-C5 monoclonal antibody) for an aHUS-like TMA; vs. treatment of specific infections, modification of immune suppressive drugs, and etc.

We seek to define the incidence, response to therapy, and profile of TMA-like disorders developing in the allo stem cell transplant setting by longitudinal follow-up, over 1year, of patients seen at NYPH. We typically perform 120 adult allo stem cell transplants annually and anticipate that 60-90 will agree to enroll in this serial follow-up. Staining of microvascular endothelial cells from any tissue in the body for deposition of terminal complement components (C5b-9 and C5a) has been shown in anecdotal reports to help distinguish aHUS from TTP. As patients receiving allo stem cell transplants are required to undergo serial bone marrow biopsies for their clinical evaluation, at day-7, day 28, day 100, day 180, one year, and at time of relapse (if any), the most readily accessible tissue specimens for us would be marrow core biopsy slides.",5,"transplant","Admin approved - BH 05/24/2014",1,23-APR-14,"2 unstained slides per procedure (i.e., bone marrow biopsies) with 120 patients and 5 procedures per patient at $7  per unstained slide = $8400

Unfortunately, triple negative breast cancer one of the more aggressive subtypes has no current actionable targets identified for therapy. 

Cancer testis (CT) antigens are proteins which are expressed in the germ cells of developing fetal and adult gonads but not in any other adult tissues.  Recently, CT antigens were found to be expressed in various cancer cells including breast cancer. Due to the restricted pattern of expression of CT antigens in normal tissue, CT antigens when expressed by cancer cells will elicit an immune response to the tumor. This raises the possibility of their use as therapeutic cancer vaccine targets. The CT antigen MAGE-A (Melanoma associated antigen ?A) was initially identified in melanoma has since been studied in various cancers. MAGE-A was among the first human tumor antigens shown to elicit a spontaneous cytotoxic T cell response in cancer patients and vaccine trials with this antigen are currently underway in lung cancer.2, 3

There have been variable reports of MAGE-A expression in breast cancer, with MAGE-A positivity ranging from 20-74%. 4 More recently Chen et. al looked at the expression of CT antigens in a comprehensive immunohistochemical study of 454 invasive ductal carcinomas of the breast and found MAGE-A to be more frequently expressed in ER (Estrogen receptor) negative tumors. MAGE-A was expressed in 12-24% of ER negative tumors compared to 2-6% of ER positive tumors (p<0.001). 4 This differential expression between hormone receptor positive and negative tumors makes it a potential target for triple negative tumors. The expression of CT antigens is also dependent on pathologic features of the tumor such as size, histologic grade and lymph node metastasis.5 Although MAGE-A expression has been studied in breast cancer, the specific expression of MAGE-A in triple negative breast cancer and its correlation with pathologic tumor features and clinical outcomes has not been studied. 

Given the limited treatment options in triple negative breast cancer, the characterization of MAGE-A expression in triple negative breast cancer and its potential use as a vaccine target in this group is a unique opportunity for investigation.

Research Design

1.	Investigate the expression of MAGE-A in triple negative breast cancer. This will be done by immunohistochemical staining of an existing triple negative breast cancer tissue microarray. The tissue microarray contains pathologic tumor sections for 161 patients with triple negative breast cancer treated at Weill Cornell Medical Center. Staining will be performed using optimized MAGE-A antibodies. Interpretation will be performed by a WCMC pathologist. Tumors will be characterized and scored by their pattern and intensity of staining for MAGE-A.

2.	Correlate MAGE-A staining with clinicopathologic features and clinical outcomes in triple negative breast cancer. A chart review of patients included in the triple negative breast cancer tissue microarray will be performed looking at clinical, demographic, pathologic, treatment and follow-up data. This will be correlated with MAGE-A staining to determine whether there is an association with aggressive pathologic features as well as recurrence and survival.",5,"tdalfo01","Admin approved - BH 6/17/2014",1,13-JUN-14,"We will stain 1 unstained TMA slide with MAGE-A antibody.

In myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) category, distinguishing prefibrotic/early stage primary myelofibrosis (PMF) from essential thrombocythemia (ET) is mainly based on the histologic, clinic and laboratory findings according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification criteria [1]. But the all features of diseases can be similar in prefibrotic PMF and ET. In this situation, diagnosis of such cases remains unclear and is placed in MPN, unclassifiable [2]. This ambiguity has been leading to find more contributory methods to reach specific diagnosis which is crucial because clinical course and outcome vary considerably between these entities [3]. Recently, immunohistochemical overexpression of NF-E2 antibody in erythroid cells was shown to be more elevated in prefibrotic PMF than ET and proposed as a helpful tool to favor diagnosis of PMF [4].

Objective

The aim of this study is to find more useful ways to discriminate between prefibrotic PMF and ET, when diagnosis is unclear. 

Material and Method
The study includes 20 prefibrotic PMF, 20 advanced PMF and 20 ET cases, diagnosed between 2008 and 2014. For this purpose, patients? haematoxylin-eosin slides and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded bone marrow/clot biopsy blocks at the time of diagnosis will be used. All cases will be stained immunohistochemically with NF-E2 and P53 as well as NGFR, CD138, CD3, CD20 and CD34 in order to determine characteristics of accompanying stromal cells, inflammatory cells, and microvessel density. The proportion and intensity of NF-E2 and P53 staining together with specification of the stromal composition, inflammatory background and microvessel density will be evaluated and compared between PMF and ET cases. Also, patients? cytogenetic alterations, complete blood count results, LDH levels, and splenic sizes will be tried to correlate with immunohistochemical findings.

Since that time, the PCPI has not been widely adopted because it is a costly, labor intensive, ex vivo test, requiring live cells, a dark room and specialized technologist training.  In order to bring this valuable prognostic information into wide availability for routine patient care, we invented a technically feasible platform, double staining myeloma biopsies for CD138 (plasma cell membrane) /Ki67 (US Patent 20100151447).  Multivariate analysis of newly diagnosed/treatment naive patients showed that only proliferation had an independent effect on survival (p = 0.000).

However, FSA involves tissue processing resulting in freezing artifacts and destruction of the tissue. If such artifacts occur at the surgical margins, it may hinder the margin assessment with major implications on prognosis. Sectioning results in significant wastage of tissue, a major concern for small biopsies that may be lost for ancillary diagnostic studies, such as immuno-staining. FSA also results in a procedural delay of 20-30 minutes, lengthening the time the patient stays under general anesthesia, increasing patient morbidity as well as cost of the procedure. Thus there is a need for techniques that can provide quick diagnostic assessment of the tissue in real-time without the need for tissue processing. Optical imaging techniques such as multiphoton microscopy (MPM) and full field OCT (FFOCT) provides high-resolution, subcellular images from fresh (unprocessed) tissue.  
Purpose and objective: We aim to explore the ex vivo applications of MPM and FFOCT in the practice of pathology for rapid evaluation of the tissue.
Methodology: Fresh (unprocessed), non-diagnostic human (?waste?) tissues will be collected from neoplastic and non-neoplastic areas of various organs. These sections will be imaged with both MPM and FFOCT and then submitted in 10% formalin to translational research for tissue processing and H&E staining. Finally, a blinded analysis will be performed by comparing MPM/FFOCT images with their corresponding H&E to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of these optical techniques.

Over time, the myelocytes, monocytes, and blasts crowd out the red blood cells and platelets in the bone marrow. When this happens, infection, anemia, or easy bleeding may occur.

The study drug, ruxolitinib, targets the JAK1 and JAK2 pathways. JAK1 and JAK2 are present in CMML. By targeting the JAK1 and JAK2 pathway, ruxolitnib could potentially help control the overproduction of blood cells.

The study has 2 parts (participants will only be enrolled in 1 part). 

In Part 1, different groups of participants will receive increasing dose levels of Ruxolitinib to find the dose that has the most effect while still being tolerated by participants. Part 2 will study how the maximum tolerated dose (determined in Part 1) affects the cancer. 

Participants will take Ruxolitinib twice daily in 28 day cycles. Participants will continue on study treatment for as long as they are responding to therapy and not experiencing unacceptable side effects, but not past Week 48 of treatment.",5,"leukemia","Admin approved - BH 6/19/2014",1,16-JUN-14,"A portion of this protocol's budget is reserved for pathology department work order requests.

Microsatellite Instability (MSI) present in sporadic colorectal cancers is linked to favorable prognosis and presence of the genomic variant BRAF V600E in MSI cancers has an excellent prognosis. We will study the role of additional genomic variants underlying the differential prognostic responses seen in CRC microsatellite stable (MSS) and unstable (MSI) tumors with or without the BRAF V600E mutation, using targeted Next generation Sequencing (NGS). Key mutations such as APC, KRAS, BRAF, SMAD4, TP53 and FBXW7 will be interrogated and novel associations detected by the cancer panel will be analyzed. The mutational profiles of MSI and MSS CRC may help to identify key genomic differences that are correlated with prognosis and/or therapeutic selection.

We have analyzed 30 resection specimens containing colonic adenomas, all of which were biopsied during prior endoscopic procedures, compared to 10 polypectomy specimens that contained invasive adenocarcinoma. We noted that resected polyps that had been previously biopsied contained displaced mucosal elements in the submucosa, often with an infiltrative contour reminiscent of invasive adenocarcinoma.  Displaced mucosa is often surrounded by a rim of lamina propria and associated with signs of trauma, including granulation tissue, hemorrhage and/or hemosiderin deposition, erosions, and reactive fibroblastic proliferation, which may help to exclude the possibility of invasive adenocarcinoma in some cases.  These features, however, are not consistently present and lack adequate sensitivity and specificity to reliably distinguish between biopsy-related trauma and malignancy in our series.  
Previous studies have demonstrated that differential expression of immunohistochemical markers, such as p53 and Ki67, aid the distinction between displaced mucosal elements and invasive adenocarcinoma in colonic polyps with ?pseudoinvasion? due to torsion.1, 2  We would like to apply our findings and these immunohistochemical stains to a larger series of polyps in order to evaluate their utility in identifying biopsy-related epithelial displacement in colonic adenomas.

In order to do this, we plan to:

The rate of these complications range from 48% to 52% at 5 years and 69-70% at 10 years after diagnosis, with approximately half of the patients developing strictures. Although strictures can develop at any site affected by Crohn?s disease, the most common location of de novo strictures is the ileum and the ileocolonic region. And it remains one of the main indications for surgery in Crohn?s disease.
Traditionally, the stricture formation in Crohn?s disease has been attributed to submucosal fibrosis after ulceration. It was also reported that obliterative muscularization of the submucosa may be pathogenetically involved in its formation.  However, no in depth histologic and immunohistochemical study has been done to characterize the mucosal/mesenchymal remodeling process of the stricture. This information will undoubtedly contribute to an increased understanding of the pathogenesis of this process. Our preliminary observations indicate that the mucosa in areas of stricture frequently shows pyloric metaplasia.  If this observation is corroborated, pyloric metaplasia might serve as a histologic biomarker to monitor disease progression and risk of stricture formation. 
  
The aim of this study is to identify the pathologic features of small bowel strictures in Crohn?s disease.

For this aim:
Clinical history will be obtained from the electronic medical record.   We will review 20 to 30 cases of ileal resections for Crohn?s disease with strictures, 20 cases of colonic resection for ulcerative colitis, and 20 cases of small intestine resections for chronic ischemic enteritis and radiation enteritis and intractable pouchitis.

Exosomes are new potential candidates for exchanges between a tumor and its cellular neighbors.

Recently, various driver mutations for potential therapeutic targets have been identified in pulmonary adenocarcinomas such as in EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, and HER2. Apart from the single gene mutations oncogenic gene fusions such as the EML4-ALK, CD74-ROS, KIF5B-RET, SLC3A2-NRG1, EZR-ERBB4, TRIM24-BRAF fusions etc., are also described in lung cancers. The recent discovery of CD74 and neuregulin-1 (NRG1) gene fusion has focused our attention at this oncogenic fusion as a potential target for diagnosis of PMA [1]. Till date there are ten cases with CD74-NRG1 gene fusions that are reported in the literature [2,3]. Most of the patients carrying this oncogenic fusion are women, never smokers, and more specifically in PMA. In one report it was observed that the CD74-NRG1 gene fusions were exclusively observed in patients with KRAS mutation negative cases, thus suggesting that these oncogenic fusions are ideal therapeutic targets [3]. 

Aim: To identify the frequency and study the clinical and pathological significance of the CD74-NRG1 fusion in PMA patients seen at our institution.

Strengths of this study: This will be a first study to evaluate CD74-NRG1 fusion in a large series of PMA cases by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay. 

Plan: 
i.Retrospective analyses of 131 cases with morphological PMA diagnosis will be included in this study.
ii.Tissue microarray will be constructed (two blocks)
iii.FISH experiment using the CD74-NRG1 translocation probe and NRG1 break apart probes will be performed to identify the positive cases.
iv.The clinical pathological significance of the positive cases will be studied and compared with the CD74-NRG1 fusion negative cases.

However, FSA involves tissue processing resulting in freezing artifacts and destruction of the tissue. If such artifacts occur at the surgical margins, it may hinder the margin assessment with major implications on prognosis. Sectioning results in significant wastage of tissue, a major concern for small biopsies that may be lost for ancillary diagnostic studies, such as immuno-staining. FSA also results in a procedural delay of 20-30 minutes, lengthening the time the patient stays under general anesthesia, increasing patient morbidity as well as cost of the procedure. Thus there is a need for techniques that can provide quick diagnostic assessment of the tissue in real-time without the need for tissue processing. Optical imaging techniques such as multiphoton microscopy (MPM), full field OCT (FFOCT), 7 Tesla MRI etc. provides high-resolution histological comparable images from fresh (unprocessed) tissue.  
Purpose and objective: We aim to explore the ex vivo applications optical techniques in the practice of genitourinary pathology for rapid evaluation of the tissue.
Methodology: Imaging will be performed on the small sections or biopsies obtained from various genitourinary specimens (kidney, testis, bladder, prostate etc.) received in surgical pathology. Only the tissue judged as ""waste"" or excess tissue (i.e not required for diagnostic purpose) by the attending uro-pathologist, Dr. Robinson will be collected for imaging. These sections will be collected in saline and brought to the imaging suite for imaging by the research pathologist, Dr. Jain. The imaging session will be performed under the guidance of Dr. Jain. The entire imaging session will not take more than 2 hours. Upon completion of the imaging, the tissues will be submitted for permanent section (FFPE) and or frozen section. Not every tissue will be brought back to surgical pathology. The tissues that will not returned to surgical pathology will be processed for FFPE in translational research core lab. Only the tissues that will be requested back by the attending pathologist will be brought back to surgical pathology and will be processed there. In addition to imaging fresh tissues from surgical specimens, we would also perform a retrospective study, where unstained, de-paraffinized slides will be imaged. This will be done only for certain types of diseases that are uncommon or underrepresented in our study, to increase our sample size and diagnostic accuracy.

In support of this concept, we have recently shown that the combination of non-rearranged BCL2 gene and a high proliferation index (BCL2-N/HPI phenotype) characterizes a subset of localized, nodal FL in both children and adults that resembles pediatric FL and displays particularly indolent clinical behavior without progression after treatment.  On the basis of these preliminary findings, we hypothesize that the BCL2-N/HPI phenotype may be used to distinguish those cases of limited-stage FL that have the potential for progression/ recurrence from those that do not.   Although our preliminary study on PTFL supports this hypothesis, it involved relatively small numbers of adult nodal cases, and did not evaluate therapy-specific outcomes.  In fact, many of the adult patients with pediatric-type FL included in the study received chemotherapy; thus the contribution of chemotherapy to good outcomes in this older age group was uncertain.  As a result, the study fell short of providing sufficient evidence that the BCL2-N/HPI phenotype defines a distinct subset of adult FL that remains localized irrespective of therapeutic approach.  To this end, we plan to retrospectively review all nodal and extra-nodal limited-stage FL cases (grade 1-3) from four academic institutions and directly assess the ability of the BCL2-N/HPI phenotype to predict the likelihood of progression / recurrence after observation alone, XRT alone, rituximab-XRT, or chemotherapy +/- XRT.",5,"sbarouk","Admin approved - BH 8/14/2014",1,01-AUG-14,"32 cases

In cell culture, PEL express high levels, but in other lymphoma cell lines, levels of ADK are low but can be induced by culturing at higher cell densities. We hypothesize that ADK will be expressed in vivo in a subset of lymphoma specimens, and that immunohistochemistry is a biomarker for response to this drug. We will perform immunohistochemistry for ADK in tissue microarray for diverse lymphoma subtypes, including DLBCL, Hodgkin and AIDS-related lymphomas.


AMENDMENT 5/19/2016:

Though our work that focuses on virus-associated malignancies we discovered a new small molecule, that is a very effective inhibitor of primary effusion lymphoma cell lines in cell culture and in a mouse xenograft model. Through extensive molecular characterization to assess the mechanism of action of this drug, which is a nucleoside analogue, we found that it is actually a pro-drug activated by ADK, and other ADK expressing cancers are also sensitive. Specifically, differentiated plasma cell tumors, such as multiple myeloma, also expressed ADK, and are sensitive to this drug, while other less differentiated large cell lymphomas are not. 
We are requesting to amend this project to include additional IHC for other tumor types for which there is evidence in public databases (cBIOportal, Oncomine, Human Protein Atlas). Several carcinoma types also appear to express high levels of ADK. Based on this, we tested three colon cancer cell lines, and all three showed high sensitivity to our drug (at around 100 nM), and expression of high levels of ADK by Western blot. A second cancer type that is of great interest to us, is breast cancer, because public data suggests that high levels of ADK are associated with the triple negative subtype. We are requesting immunohistochemistry for ADK in an extended panel of 100 solid tumors, including 25 cases of colorectal cancer, 25 cases of breast cancer of different types, and 50 cases of other carcinomas, including pancreatic, lung and liver, for which there is also evidence of ADK expression in a subset of cases. We will work with the subsepcialist in surgical pathology to identify appropriate cases selection and assessment of immunoreactivity (i.e. Dr. Jessurun for colorectal ca, Dr. Shin for breast, etc). We will do this in stages, where the first stage is assessment of colorectal ca, and Dr. Jessurun has agreed and selected a cohort 25 cases of diverse molecular and histologic subtype.

AIDS related lymphomas are often molecularly distinct from their non-AIDS counterparts.  A major limitation in the genomic study of rare tumors such as AIDS-related BL is the reliance on frozen tissue.  Our group has overcome this limitation by performing targeted genomic sequencing on a platform optimized for use with formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue.  We have now expanded and customized this sequencing panel to include genes common in hematologic malignancies and specifically Burkitt lymphoma.  In this proposal we plan to evaluate the genetic composition of AIDS-related BL with a focus on therapeutically targetable alterations and molecular determinants of outcome.  We hypothesize that 1) AIDS-related BL will harbor unique genomic alterations compared with non-AIDS BL and 2) that alterations can be used to predict clinical outcome.  We plan to test this hypothesis through the following specific aims:

Aim 1: Describe the spectrum of genetic alterations in AIDS-related BL.  High throughput targeted genomic sequencing will be performed on a cohort of AIDS-related BL using a targeted gene panel specific for hematologic malignancies. 
Aim 2: Identify genetic alterations with prognostic relevance. The clinical significance of alterations identified in Aim 1 will be determined by univariate analysis evaluating the impact of the alteration(s) on event free survival and overall survival.

In Phase 2b, a total of 148 adult male and female subjects will be randomized in equal numbers to receive either azacitidine in combination with birinapant or azacitidine in combination with placebo.

Birinapant (TL32711), a potent, bivalent SMAC-mimetic investigational agent, has demonstrated synergistic antitumor activity when combined with cytotoxic (or ""demethylating"") agents, including azacitidine and cytarabine, in studies in established AML cell lines and primary AML
blast samples, whereas single-agent cytotoxics showed little activity. In vivo studies of AML xenotransplant models demonstrated promising activity when birinapant was combined with cytarabine or azacitidine. This synergistic activity is potentially due to induction of tumor

Endometrial carcinoma is the most common malignant tumor of female genital tract with 10-20 new cases per 100,000 per year.  Endometrial carcinoma falls in to two different categories: type I and type II. Type I carcinomas are estrogen-related carcinomas, usually associated with preexisting complex hyperplasia. In contrast, type II is an aggressive non-estrogen driven carcinoma (serous and clear cell carcinoma).  Multiple studies have proven that molecular alterations differ between type I from type II carcinoma. The most common molecular alterations involved in the pathogenesis of type I cancers are: PTEN, B-catenin and KRAS. By contrast to type I, type II carcinomas show p53 mutations. Human Scribble is a recently described gene implicated in the pathogenesis of human cancer.  Scribble is a member of the LAP (PDZ and LRR) gene family1 that localizes to the basolateral aspects of adherent junctions and maintains apical-basal polarity in normal epithelia.  Scribble is tumor suppressor gene and loss of functions leads to uncontrolled proliferation and tissue growth. There are only limited studies which map the normal distribution of Scribble in human tissue and its abnormal distribution in cancers and precancerous lesions.  Rare studies on the breast cancer showed that mislocalized Scribble phenotype exhibits a complete loss of function.  
Aim of the study:

The aim of this study is to map the distribution of Scribble protein by immunohistochemistry in benign endometrium, precancerous lesions (complex hyperplasia without atypia and complex atypical hyperplasia) and malignant type I and type II carcinomas.  Potentially, this could be a novel marker for progression of benign endometrium to complex atypical hyperplasia and endometrial carcinoma.  We will also differentiate the distribution and accumulation of the Scribble protein in type I and type II cancers.

The project was initiated in 2011 in Dr. Neil Bander?s laboratory and is almost completed. Among other findings, our study demonstrated PSMA expression in tumor endothelium in 21 cases of primary ovarian carcinoma and 3 cases of metastatic ovarian carcinoma, however PSMA was not identified in the endothelium of adjacent normal tissues. Based on these findings we would like to increase the number of metastatic ovarian tumors to 15, as these are the sites that might be potentially targeted with anti-PSMA strategies. 
The immunostaining for PSMA and CD-31 (reference endothelial marker) will be performed in Dr. Neil Bander?s laboratory.

In cases with overlapping or ambiguous morphology, histological features alone cannot distinguish these entities. One of the key hallmarks of lobular differentiation is loss of expression of the E-cadherin gene (CHD1) located on chromosome 16q. Mouse monoclonal anti-E-cadherin immunostains (Mouse Ecad) have been used by pathologist for years to distinguish ductal vs lobular carcinomas, with published sensitivity and specificity rates of approximately 90%. A new rabbit monoclonal anti-E-cadherin (Rabbit Ecad) has recently been shown to have increased sensitivity in ductal breast carcinomas, however, the number of cases of DCIS was limited (n=8) (Hoang et al. 2014). This recent study additionally evaluated the use of Rabbit Ecad plus p120 catenin cocktail in comparison with the Mouse Ecad alone in lobular carcinomas, again however, the number of cases of LCIS was limited (n=3).  Another recent study (Li et al. 2014) evaluated the use of Rabbit Ecad + p120 catenin in distinguishing DCIS and LCIS, however, their number of cases was also limited (n=15 DCIS, n=12 LCIS). They also did not evaluate the use of Rabbit Ecad +p120 vs Mouse Ecad alone. The purpose of this study is to further evaluate the new Rabbit Ecad. Our aims are:
1. Determine the sensitivity of Rabbit Ecad vs Mouse Ecad in distinguishing DCIS (low, intermediate, and high grade) from LCIS (classical and pleomorphic). 
2. Compare Rabbit Ecad and Rabbit Ecad + p120 to Mouse Ecad alone in LCIS (classical and pleomorphic). 
For aims 1 and 2, we will construct 2 tissue microarrays. One will be composed of 50 cases of LCIS, with 25 cases each of classical and pleomorphic types. The other will be composed of 50 cases of DCIS, with 26 cases of high nuclear grade and 13 each of low and intermediate nuclear grades. All cases of DCIS will be evaluated with both Rabbit and Mouse Ecad. Cases of LCIS will be evaluated with Rabbit Ecad, Rabbit Ecad + p120, and Mouse Ecad.

have been designed to study the tumorigenic contribution of many genomic defects. However, many of them lack the complexity of mouse
systems (selected cell lines in vitro poorly represent the landscape of any given disease) and in the case of transgenic mice, each Tg
aberrantly express the selected defect in all target cells (lymphoid, epithelial, etc.). Moreover, Tg models, with rare exception, do not
recapitulate the complexity arising by multiple defects proper of many human cancers. Contrary, PDT carry ?physiological drivers? and
recapitulate very closely human tumors. With this program, we anticipate to engraft a series of human primary hematological and nonhematological
disorders. Successfully engraftments will be propagated with three main objectives i) characterize individual tumor and define a

The goal of this bronchoscopy sub study will be to bank samples for future analyses using the parameters described in this protocol.A total of 300 SPIROMICS subjects will be enrolled in the study at various sites; however, only around 50 subjects will be enrolled at this site.

The Bronchoscopy sub-study plans to recruit 60 participants from the healthy controls stratum, 60 from the smokers without COPD, 140 from the mild/moderate COPD stratum and 40 from the severe COPD stratum. We consider power for three potential sub-group comparisons:

The amount of neuroendocrine differentiation is thought to increase with disease progression and after treatment with androgen deprivation therapy, and contributes to many tumors developing hormonal refractoriness and a rapidly aggressive clinical course.

As patients with prostate cancer are not typically biopsied during the course of their disease, the amount of neuroendocrine differentiation in tumor tissue is not easy to measure.  Secreted neuroendocrine biopeptides can be measured in the blood and can serve as surrogate markers of neuroendocrine differentiation.  Serum chromogranin A(CgA) and neuron specific enolase (NSE) are commonly checked, and known to correlate with the amount of neuroendocrine differentiation present in tumor tissue (Angelson, The Prostate 1998).  The level  of serum CgA and NSE at diagnosis has been shown to be associated with a poorer prognosis (Taplin et al, Urology 2005, Maroto-Ray, ASCO 2009, Ishiki et al, J of Urol 2002)

The study consists of a Phase1b lead-in portion to determine the MTD of OMP-59R5 in combination with nab-paclitaxel at 125 mg/m2 and gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8 and 15 of every 28-day cycle, followed by a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled portion to evaluate the efficacy and safety of OMP-59R5 in combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine in subjects with previously untreated stage IV pancreatic cancer (APPENDIX A Study Schema). The initial dose escalation will be done in combination with gemcitabine alone up to 5 mg/kg of OMP-59R5. Subsequent cohorts will be treated with OMP-59R5 and Nab-P+Gem starting with the OMP-59R5 dose of 5 mg/kg, which was the highest dose at which <1 DLT occurred in 3-4 subjects treated with OMP-59R5 and gemcitabine.

o	The purpose of this study is to compare whether adding ibrutinib to the standard chemotherapy options for this population (BR or R-CHOP) result in a longer progression-free survival than BR or R-CHOP alone. 
o	The type of chemotherapy received (BR or R-CHOP) will be dependent on refractory versus relapsed disease, type of indolent Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, and number of prior lines of therapy. 
o	Ibrutinib is a type of drug called a kinase inhibitor. Kinases are proteins inside cells that help cells live and grow. The study drug is believed to block a kinase that helps blood cancer cells live and grow. By blocking this, it is possible that the study drug will kill cancer cells or stop them from growing.

As a result, pathologists are often forced to diagnose tumors from these other primary sites on the basis of exclusion.

The advancement in microRNA research has so far identified approximately 1140 human miRNA species, and several tissue-specific miRNAs have emerged.  Examples include miR-122 in liver, miR-9 and miR-124 in brain, miR-372/373 in germ cell tumors among others.  Recent progress in miRNA sequencing has led to additional potentially tissue-specific miRNAs, including miR-375 that we found to be highly expressed in many neuroendocrine tumors, through our recent collaborating projects with Dr. Neil Renwick (who had an adjunct appointment in our department until July 2014).

The expression of these tissue-specific miRNA and other candidates could be retained or lost in neoplasms derived from these tissues, and these characteristics means that these miRNAs could be potentially diagnostic or prognostic markers.  For instance, expression of miR-122 is a specific diagnostic marker for hepatocellular carcinoma.  On the other hand, miR-122 expression is often lost in hepatocellular carcinomas that are clinically aggressive, and anti-miR122 is being tested as a therapeutic agent. The current literature on these tissue-specific miRNA, however, is scant and incomplete, and the sensitivity and specificity of these tissue-specific miRNAs in non-neoplastic tissue from various sites, is largely unknown.

Being in a department of pathology, we are well poised to evaluate the diagnostic potential of these emerging tissue-specific miRNAs.  Our specific experimental plans are:

1.	Identify paraffin blocks of all normal tissues and extract total RNA from tissue cores of these tissues, paying attention to avoid contaminations, e.g. colonic epithelium versus colonic wall (smooth muscle).
2.	Evaluate tissue-specificity of candidate miRNA on the normal tissue panel by qRT-PCR using commercial primers and reagents.
3.	Once the tissue specificity is confirmed, evaluate their expression in benign and malignant neoplasms from the corresponding organ and from tumors that are potentially in the differential diagnosis by qRT-PCR to define the sensitivity and specificity as a diagnostic tool.

This project will need technical assistance from the Molecular Lab for RNA extraction and qRT-PCR.

Approximately 10-20% of CIN1 progress to CIN2-3. The search for markers which would help to identify patients who are at risk of progression is ongoing.

Recent studies from the Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women?s Hospital, described a putative cell of origin for CIN and cervical cancer at the squamocolumnar junction (SCJ). These cells are positive for SCJ-specific antibodies such as keratin7, AGR2, MMP7, and GDA. Subsequent study showed that HSILs are almost always SCJ+, but LSILs include SCJ- and SCJ+ subsets. Comparing SCJ- and SCJ+ LSILs, 0/54 (0%) and 8/33 (24.2%) had an HSIL outcome, respectively. The researchers concluded that SCJ biomarkers in conjunction with histology may segregate LSILs with very low risk of HSIL outcome and conceivably such markers could be used as a management tool.

In our division we have a set of 300 cases of LSIL with known 3-year follow up, and established HPV and biomarker characteristics. We would like to test the hypothesis that the newly described SCJ markers are predictive of the clinical course of LSIL using our group of cases. As a pilot we propose CK7 immunostaining of 30 cases of LSIL that regressed and 30 cases that progressed, matched for patient age and HPV viral type.

We previously discovered over-expression and gene amplification of both AURKA (encodes the cell cycle regulating Aurora kinase A) and of MYCN (encodes the oncogenic transcription factor N-Myc) in NEPC as compared to prostate adenocarcinoma. MYCN is similarly amplified in a subgroup of neuroblastoma, a pediatric neuroendocrine tumor. In both prostate cancer and neuroblastoma, MYCN amplification is indicative of extremely poor prognosis. Our previous work has shown that Aurora-A and N-Myc associate with and stabilize each other in both tumor entities, preventing their proteasomal degradation. More recently, we found that the stabilizing interaction of Aurora-A and N-Myc can be disrupted by small molecule ligands of Aurora-A. Here we propose to explore whether these findings will allow improved targeting of NEPC. 
In this study, we aim to translate these findings into new therapeutic strategies for NEPC. We will study how N-Myc cooperates with Aurora-A to induce a neuroendocrine phenotype and identify critical downstream targets of the N-Myc/Aurora-A complex (Aim 1).  We will analyze the effect of MLN8237 and related compounds on N-Myc function and their ability to abrogate a neuroendocrine phenotype (Aim 2). Based on our previous work, we speculate that Aurora-A recruits a de-ubiquitinating enzyme (Usp) to stabilize N-Myc. siRNA-based screening has now identified candidate Usps that may mediate the stabilizing effect of Aurora-A on N-Myc. We will test the functions of these Usps in N-Myc driven NEPC and extend the siRNA screen to search for NEPC-specific Usps that stabilize N-Myc. Finally, we will make use of clinical and pathological data, including primary and metastatic tumors from patients enrolled in a multi-institutional Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating MLN8237 for patients with NEPC led by our group to validate our mechanistic findings (Aim 3). More specifically, we will screen prostate cancer archival tissue (FFPE blocks of individual cases and TMAs that are comprised of mutliple prostate cancer types (adenocarcinoma, CRPC and NEPC). In summary, we believe that these important insights on Aurora-A and N-Myc and their oncogenic roles in driving NEPC will allow us to develop a novel treatment strategy for men with NEPC and spur the development of potent 2nd generation compounds to disrupt the Aurora-A/N-Myc complex.

While commonly associated with infection by Helicobacter pylori and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the specific molecular pathways involved in cancer formation and progression have remained elusive compared to other gastrointestinal cancers. Recently, a number of large-scale molecular analyses including that of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) have classified gastric cancers according to specific molecular pathways. DNA sequencing and gene expression profiling have facilitated identification of four groups of gastric cancer: those associated with EBV, microsatellite unstable tumors, genomically stable tumors, and tumors with chromosomal instability. Although clinical and histological characteristics were also recorded in the TCGA database, the study did not stratify molecular characteristics for morphological subtypes of gastric cancer. We have noted that medullary gastric carcinomas, characterized by a dense lymphocytic infiltrate and syncytial growth pattern, show mutually exclusive molecular changes, namely EBV+/MSS, EBV-/MSI-H, and EBV-/MSS. We would like to further evaluate the molecular features of this cancer subtype. 
We plan to investigate molecular alterations present in 35 cases of gastric medullary carcinoma. Paraffin-embedded tissue will be subjected to Next Generation Sequencing using the Comprehensive Cancer Panel (CCP) from Life technologies, which interrogates 400 known cancer-related genes including host genomic signatures. Sequencing will be performed on the ion Proton platform (Life Technologies).

Thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs), defined by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and evidence of organ dysfunction, complicate 10-20% of such transplants, and are associated with increased mortality; three year survival rates are as low as 11%. A variety of etiologies for TA-TMA have been proposed, including endothelial cell damage by chemotherapy and radiation used in transplant conditioning regimens, immunosuppressive medications, viral infections, graft versus host disease (GvHD), and calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine and sirolimus), used to prevent and treat GvHD. Once those disorders are ruled out, and drugs discontinued or changed, about half of the cases remain active, and diagnosis and treatment is uncertain. Both intrarenal and extrarenal microthrombi have been described in autopsy series of these patients, resembling the TMAs of TTP and aHUS. However, unlike thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), a TMA characterized by an acquired or congenital deficiency of the von Willebrand factor cleaving protease ADAMTS13, TA-TMAs have a detectable ADAMTS13 activity, autoantibody inhibitors are not found, and TA-TMA does not respond to plasma exchange (PEx). These observations suggest that TA-TMA is not a TTP-like syndrome, and that therapies beyond PEx are needed. Uncontrolled activation of the alternative complement pathway due to a congenital mutation in one or more complement or complement regulatory protein mutations or, in rare instances, possibly autoantibodies to complement regulatory proteins, is the driving mechanism in aHUS. The anti-C5 mAb eculizumab has drastically altered morbidity associated with this disease.  Complement-related mutations and elevated levels of terminal complement components (TCC) C5b-9 (membrane attack complex , MAC) and C5a have been reported in aHUS-like TMAs linked to organ and tissue transplants, including a few instances of allogenic HSCT TMAs.

Clinical Immunology 144:109-116, 2012).  When LN are stimulated, FRCs undergo proliferative expansion, and during chronic inflammation this process is actively maintained. Understanding the role of FRCs in maintaining chronic inflammation might enable targeting this process in patients with chronic immune mediated diseases, like SLE. 

In mice, CD11c+ dendritic cells (DCs) maintain FRC survival through up-regulation of FRC podoplanin (PDPN) (Lu, et al: Immunity 42:719-730, 2015).  PDPN, in turn, modulates lymphocyte-FRC adhesion, which promotes FRC survival via FAK phosphorylation (pFAK). In mice, this DC-stromal axis is active in reactive LNs, but not in unstimulated LNs. 

Our aim is to validate the DC-stromal-PDPN-pFAK axis in human LNs. To establish the relationship between human DCs and up-regulation of PDPN and pFAK, we will compare multiplex immunostains in a group of unstimulated LNs vs. reactive LNs:

Metaplastic carcinomas are characterized by a ?triple-negative? (ER-/PR-/HER2-) immunophenotype and a basal-like gene expression profile.

There are only rare reports describing the intimate association of certain metaplastic carcinomas, including metaplastic spindle cell carcinoma (MSCC) and low-grade adenosquamous carcinoma (LGASC) with complex sclerosing and papillary lesions. 1,2 Cases demonstrating this interesting association have also been collected at this institution, the preliminary results of which were presented as a platform at a prior USCAP meeting.3 We have subsequently collected additional cases (and likely possess the largest series) and have performed a series of immunohistochemical stains pertinent to metaplastic carcinoma, including p63, various cytokeratins, and basal-like markers (TRC Project 14240).  However, to date, we and others have yet to elucidate, immunohistochemically or otherwise, this uncommon association between seemingly unrelated entities and the biologic underpinnings of this relationship.

PIK3CA is one of the most frequently mutated genes in breast cancer, with activating mutations present in about 25% of cases.3 Clinically significant protein products include the p110&#61537; and p110&#61538; isoforms that leads to the activation of AKT via, PIP3. The end effects include cellular proliferation and survival. Downregulation of this pathway occurs through the PTEN gene by dephosphorylating PIP3 thus acting as a tumor suppressor gene4. 

These mutations have been identified in benign and precursor lesions such as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Recently, PIK3CA/AKT pathway mutations have been identified in papillary neoplasms of the breast, and are interestingly seen more frequently in benign lesions (papillomas), indicating that some papillary carcinomas evolve via a different molecular pathway.5

Our hypothesis is that there is activation of the PIK3CA/AKT pathway in papillary tumors and the metaplastic carcinomas arising within them which can be demonstrated using immunohistochemistry.  If successful, we will have identified a possible mechanism by which (metaplastic) carcinomas can develop from pre-existing papillary lesions including benign examples.  Four immunostains, PTEN, PIP3-E, p110&#61537; and p110&#61538;, will be performed on paraffin tissue sections from study cases. We will additionally perform a PIK3CA mutational analysis on paired samples from 10 cases to further characterize the link between the two entities.

By contrast, most solid organ cancers are generally considered to contain relatively few background cells, so that exclusion is not as important.  However, we have observed that in some solid cancers, there are large numbers of stromal or inflammatory cells that express markers of interest.  The importance of excluding background cells from immunohistochemical analysis in solid cancers has not been quantified.  We hypothesize that in a significant number of cases, background cell expression of markers skews data to a clinically significant degree.

In this pilot study, we intend to develop an effective multiplex immunostain to exclude background cells from breast cancer analysis.  Then we will use the mIHC assay to quantify the contribution of background cell expression to the data.  If this study shows that background cell antigen expression is significant, we will then propose another, larger study, to explore whether mIHC provides better statistical data than traditional IHC.

Assessment of KI67 is routine in breast cancer biopsies.  In this study, we will first determine the best mIHC method for the study of Ki67 in breast cancer cells (excluding background cells from the analysis).  CK7 is a sensitive and specific marker for breast epithelium and is not expressed by stroma or inflammatory cells.  Similarly, CD138(Syndecan 1) is strongly expressed by breast epithelium, but not by stroma or inflammatory cells.  The only inflammatory cells that express CD138 are plasma cells, which are relatively rare in breast cancer biopsies.  

We will stain 4 representative specimens for CK7(red)/Ki67(brown) and for CD138(red)/Ki67(brown).  To assess the number of plasma cells, we will stain these 4 cases for CD138(red)/MUM1(brown).  *Whichever of the combinations [CK7(red)/Ki67(brown) or CD138(red)/Ki67(brown)] appears to work better, we will stain 25 representative cases of breast cancer.

While the molecular genetics have become an important area of study in more recent years, there is still much to be learned about this heterogenous group of tumors.  Full exploration of the molecular basis of endometrial cancer will provide a better understanding of this disease and potentially pave the way for novel targeted therapeutic options. 

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immunohistochemical staining patterns and molecular profiles of mixed endometrial carcinomas as defined by the presence of two or more histologic subtypes including serous, endometrioid, clear cell, and/or mucinous histology.  We will evaluate the staining patterns of these tumors with immunohistochemistry for p53, p16, ER, PR, and Ki67.  We will also look at the incidence of mutations in p53, PIK3CA, FBXW7, PTEN and microsatellite instability within distinct morphologic regions of each respective tumor.

In order to do this, we will:
1) Identify 10-15 additional cases of mixed endometrial carcinoma as defined by the presence of 2 or more histologic subtypes.
2) Analyze the pattern of immunohistochemical staining in different tumor morphologies.
3) Analyze for the presence of molecular mutations via DNA microdissection and Sanger sequencing.

While the majority of men are diagnosed in early stages, about one third of these patients will eventually develop metastatic disease. The cornerstone of treatment for metastatic prostate cancer is androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Despite initial responses, almost all patients will eventually develop disease progression.

This clinical trial is for men with metastatic prostate cancer who are either beginning hormone therapy for the first time, or have been on hormone therapy for less than 30 days. The purpose of the study is to determine the effectiveness of adding the experimental drug TAK-700 (also called orteronel, a CYP17 inhibitor) to standard hormone therapy.  TAK-700 is a pill that works by reducing the levels of testosterone and other male hormones that help the prostate cancer grow. TAK-700 acts on the adrenal glands and inside the prostate tumors and slows the amount of male hormones being produced. It is expected that, by lowering the amount of male hormones in the body, TAK-700 will control the growth of prostate cancer. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to compare overall survival in newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer patients randomly assigned to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) + TAK-700 versus ADT + bicalutamide.
Study participants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms:
? Arm 1, Standard Hormone Therapy + TAK-700: Leuprolide acetate (Lupron) or goserelin acetate (Zoladex) injection once every 3 months plus TAK-700 tablet by mouth twice a day

We have completed the first part of this project (Aim 1, below) and are now requesting statistical support to analyze the data that we have generated to this point.  The original proposal for the project appears below:


MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and many are dysregulated in human malignancies, potentially useful as diagnostic, or prognostic markers.  Dr. Neil Renwick in the Laboratory of RNA Molecular Biology at Rockefeller University performs miRNA profiling by sequencing and has developed miRNA in situ hybridization that localizes miRNA alteration in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues (FFPE).  In collaboration with Dr. Renwick, we plan to perform miRNA sequencing and profiling in selected preinvasive and invasive pancreatic, GI, and non-GI tumors.  Potential miRNA biomarkers identified will then be analyzed by FISH to validate their altered expression in tumor at tissue and cellular levels. Specific tumor types selected for analysis and the rationale for their selection are: 
1.	Pancreatic tumors:  Most pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas arise from pre-existing lesions termed pancreatic intraductal neoplasia (PanIN), whereas a smaller proportion result from malignant transformation of cystic tumors called intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN).  Both PanIN and IPMNs display a spectrum of dysplasia, ranging from low-grade to carcinoma in situ.  Current techniques and markers cannot reliably distinguish high-grade and low-grade lesions, and identification of additional molecular markers would aid patient management. 
2.	Neuroendocrine tumors: Well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (ETs) of the gastrointestinal tract are clinically heterogeneous. Some are indolent, but many have fatal consequences.  Recent evidence indicates that ETs from different gastrointestinal sites progress via diverse molecular mechanisms.  Those from the foregut (e.g. pancreas) often harbor mutations in MEN1, VHL, and TSC1/2.  ETs of the midgut (e.g. ileum) display deletions on chromosome 18 and abnormal Wnt signaling.  Hindgut (e.g. rectum) ETs show high expression of TGF?Ñ?n and its cell surface receptors, EGFR, and NOTCH.  MiRNA expression patterns may also differ among ETs and may provide potential diagnostic or prognostic indicators.
3.	Germ cell tumors: Seminoma expresses multiple germ-cell specific markers, (e.g. OCT 3/4, cancer/testis antigens).  They also harbor retrovirus-related sequences.  Viral small RNA sequences are present in viral-related neoplasms such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma (EBV) and such exogenous RNA can be of biologic and diagnostic interest. Profiling of seminoma may identify novel miRNAs specific to prenatal germ cells and retrovirus-related small RNAs.
In summary, we aim to identify miRNA markers in the above neoplasms.  We plan to 1) evaluate microRNA expression via illumina sequencing and bioinformatic analysis, generating sequence-based miRNA expression profiles and 2) use RNA FISH to validate these markers and analyze their precise expression patterns within the tumors.

For Aim 1: 
	We will identify FFPE sections from 10 cases each of: IPMN with low/intermediate-grade dyplasia, PanIN with low/intermediate grade dysplasia, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, pancreatic, ileal, and rectal ETs, seminoma and non-seminomatous germ cell tumors.  Eighty cases will be analyzed in total.
	Total RNA will be extracted from FFPE tissues in the translational research facility.

SM is further divided into different 4 subtypes: indolent SM, aggressive SM, SM with associated clonal hematological non-mast cell disease, and mast cell leukemia. The latter 3 subtypes are collectively referred to as advanced SM (ASM). The identification of ASM relies heavily on clinical features and laboratory findings indicative of aggressive disease, the so-called ?B? and ?C? findings. However, molecular events associated with aggressive disease are poorly characterized. In addition, a subset of SM patients may initially present with indolent SM but progress to aggressive disease. Currently there are limited treatment options for ASM, where targeted therapy against tyrosine kinase show limited efficacy despite the frequent presence of KIT mutations. The goal of this study is to identify biomarkers and molecular events that help predict aggressive disease without having to await for patients to develop overtly aggressive clinical features and laboratory findings, and that may be used to guide targeted therapy in the management of ASM.

It has long been noted that these antibodies are present in significantly higher proportions of patients with complications such as recurrent pregnancy loss, thrombosis, and preeclampsia. 

Patients with antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS) exhibit an abnormal antiphospholipid antibody profile as well as repeat episodes of thrombosis and/or perinatal complications.  While the symptomatology is well-recognized due to astute observation and extensive study, there is a paucity of literature demonstrating any concrete correlation between clinical diagnosis and placental histopathology.  The literature that exists is, at times, inconclusive.  Further evaluation of these patients may not only increase our understanding of the effect of antiphospholipid antibodies on pregnancy loss, but potentially aid in directing care for these patients.  

The goal of the current study is to evaluate the placentas of a group of patients with a spectrum of autoimmune disease including antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) without APLS, pre-eclampsia, and normal controls (those without any evidence or symptoms of autoimmune disease).

I am resubmitting the project under a new IRB protocol (above), for which I am the principal investigator.  The original proposal is as follows:

Sporadic microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) colonic adenocarcinomas account for approximately 15% of non-familial colon cancers and are thought to arise via the serrated neoplastic pathway.  BRAF-activating mutations are the inciting event in a subset of these tumors and, when present, distinguish them from hereditary MSI-H carcinomas, which do not harbor mutations in BRAF.  Lesions bearing BRAF mutations develop into serrated polyps that are prone to methylation of CpG island promoter regions, which results in epigenetic silencing of several genes, including the mismatch repair gene, MLH1.  Subsequent accumulation of additional mutations leads to development of invasive adenocarcinoma.  Sporadic MSI-H adenocarcinomas have traditionally been considered to have intact APC/B-catenin/Wnt signaling, but aberrant nuclear B-catenin expression has recently been reported in sessile serrated polyps, the putative precursor lesions to sporadic MSI-H colonic adenocarcinomas.  This finding suggests a role for the Wnt signaling pathway in the development of MSI-H carcinomas.  Patterns of B-catenin expression in invasive sporadic MSI-H cancers, however, have not been systematically evaluated.  
The purpose of this study is to compare immunohistochemical expression of B-catenin in sporadic MSI-H cancers to that in sporadic microsatellite stable (MSS) adenocarcinomas.  In order to do this, we will identify approximately 40 resected colonic adenocarcinomas with lost immunohistochemical expression of MLH1 and analyze them for BRAF mutations, in order to identify a subset that are likely sporadic.  A control group of 20 MSS adenocarcinomas with retained immunohistochemical expression of mismatch repair proteins will be analyzed in parallel.  All cases will be stained for B-catenin.   Assessment for BRAF mutations would be performed by Dr. Wade Samowitz, of ARUP Laboratories, who will be sent unstained tissue sections for evaluation.  Immunohistochemical stains for B-catenin would be performed in the Weill Cornell Translational Research Facility.  Stains for mismatch repair proteins have already been performed for clinical purposes on all cases.   Based on the results of these preliminary studies, we may subsequently evaluate the molecular features of MSI-H adenocarcinomas that show aberrant nuclear B-catenin expression

Due to the increase of SAA during the acute phase response, it has been suggested that SAA plays a role in host defense.  In particular, studies have shown SAA to have antiviral activity against hepatitis C virus (HCV).  In neoplastic conditions, SAA immunostaining is of diagnostic utility in differentiating subtypes of hepatocellular adenomas.  To our knowledge, the immunohistochemical staining pattern of SAA in medical liver biopsies has not been evaluated.  Furthermore, the correlation of SAA immunohistochemistry with clinicopathological parameters, such as viral loads, liver function tests, inflammatory activity, and stage of fibrosis has not been studied.

The goal of this study is to assess the immunohistochemical staining pattern of serum amyloid A in 160 liver biopsies from patients with medical liver disease.  The biopsies include 100 cases of HCV (20 cases for each stage, 0-4), 20 of hepatitis B virus, 20 of steatohepatitis, and 20 of autoimmune hepatitis.

We previously discovered over-expression and gene amplification of both AURKA (encodes the cell cycle regulating Aurora kinase A) and of MYCN (encodes the oncogenic transcription factor N-Myc) in NEPC as compared to prostate adenocarcinoma. MYCN is similarly amplified in a subgroup of neuroblastoma, a pediatric neuroendocrine tumor. In both prostate cancer and neuroblastoma, MYCN amplification is indicative of extremely poor prognosis. Our previous work has shown that Aurora-A and N-Myc associate with and stabilize each other in both tumor entities, preventing
their proteasomal degradation. More recently, we found that the stabilizing interaction of Aurora-A and NMyc can be disrupted by small molecule ligands of Aurora-A. Here we propose to explore whether these findings will allow improved targeting of NEPC. In this application, we aim to translate these findings into new therapeutic strategies for NEPC. We will study how N-Myc cooperates with Aurora-A to induce a neuroendocrine phenotype and identify critical downstream targets of the N-Myc/Aurora-A complex in cell lines, xenografts and transgenic mice over-expressing N-Myc specifically in the prostate (Aim 1). We will analyze the effect of MLN8237 and related compounds on N-Myc function and their ability to abrogate a neuroendocrine phenotype. We will use the same models described for Aim 1 (Aim 2). Based on our previous work, we speculate that Aurora-A recruits a de-ubiquitinating enzyme (Usp) to stabilize N-Myc. siRNA-based screening has now identified candidate Usps that may mediate the stabilizing effect of Aurora-A on N-Myc. We will test the functions of these Usps in N-Myc driven NEPC and extend the siRNA screen to search for NEPCspecific Usps that stabilize N-Myc. Finally, we will make use of clinical and pathological data, including primary and metastatic tumors from patients enrolled in a multi-institutional Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating MLN8237 for patients with NEPC led by our group to validate our mechanistic findings (Aim 3). In summary, we believe that these important insights on Aurora-A and N-Myc and their oncogenic roles in
driving NEPC will allow us to develop a novel treatment strategy for men with NEPC and spur the development of potent 2nd generation compounds to disrupt the Aurora-A/N-Myc complex.",5,"drickman","Admin approved - BH 05/13/2014

The Rho family is a GTPase which then targets Rho associated protein kinases (ROCK). ROCKs then regulate cytoskeletal reorganization and several cell functions. Increased level of ROCK activity has been seen in several inflammatory conditions especially in cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and recently lupus.  The role of ROCKs in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is yet unknown. 
Purpose: This study will confirm increased ROCK activity in blood and synovial tissue in RA patients undergoing hip replacement surgery (arthroplasty). Identifying the ROCK pathway in RA pathogenesis may lead to better ways to treat disease. 
Objective: In this pilot, cross sectional study, we are looking at ROCK activity of blood and synovial tissues, investigating the role of ROCK in T-helper subset activity and cytokine profile in patients with RA versus those with osteoarthritis (OA)who are undergoing hip arthroplasty. 
Methodology: We will initially recruit 20 RA patients and 20 patients with OA.  Disease assessment will be obtained two weeks pre-operatively.

Previous microRNA profiling studies on various solid tumors were almost all based on micoroarray and/or PCR-based analyses.  These methodologies, by nature, are limited by the pre-selected pools of miRNA species to be interrogated.  Through recent progress in small RNA sequencing techniques, we are now capable of generating comprehensive miRNA expression profiles using as little as 100ng of total RNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue.  Using this technique, we have sequenced several types of solid tumors (TRP project 14320), including ileal and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), pheochromocytoma, and extra-adrenal paraganglioma.  

Among these four tumor types, we found miR-375 to be universally expressed at high abundance, suggesting miR-375 as a marker for (all or a subset of) NETs.  Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of ileal and pancreatic NETs assigned all cases to the correct group based on their miRNA profiles.  Moreover, ileal NETs were associated with overexpression of oncogenic miRs -615 and -196a (653 and 248 fold changes, respectively) and low expression of tumor suppressor miR-216b, suggesting that dysregulation of these miRNAs contribute to local and distant tumor spread in ileal NETs.  Among pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma specimens, unsupervised clustering identified two molecular subgroups, with one subgroup characterized by the shutdown of a cluster of 16 miRNAs localized to chromosome 14q32. These two subgroups, however, did not correlate with clinical behavior (benign vs. malignant), anatomic sites (adrenal vs. extra-adrenal) or other clinicopathological parameters.  

Based on these promising findings, we would like to expand this miRNA sequencing project to include additional NETs and endocrine tumors.  Specifically, we would like to analyze:
1.	Benign and malignant NETs of the lung, including carcinoid tumor, atypical carcinoids, small cell carcinoma and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma
2.	Benign and malignant adrenal cortical tumors, namely adrenocortical adenoma versus carcinoma.
3.	Other benign endocrine tumors: pituitary adenoma, parathyroid adenoma, and follicular adenoma (including oncocytic variant) of the thyroid.

These sequencing data will allow us to:
1.	Evaluate the extent of miR-375 expression in various NETs and endocrine tumors (and its possible biological implications)
2.	Evaluate miRNA changes between benign, low-grade and high-grade NETs and identify miRNA markers that would potentially aid the differential diagnosis in surgical pathology, particularly between adrenocortical adenoma and carcinoma.
3.	Identify organ-specific miRNAs in these endocrine organs and evaluate their up- or down-regulation in the neoplastic counterparts.
4.	Evaluate whether there are shared miRNA dysregulation among endocrine tumors from different organs (which would imply a common pathway in the tumorigenesis).

We would like to sequence 10 specimens for each tumor type, and 2 to 3 specimens for their normal counterparts (normal adrenal, thyroid, parathyroid and pituitary glands), approximately 100 specimens in total.  One block will be identified per case, from which three tissue cores will be punched out and total RNA will need to be extracted and quantified.  Aliquots of the RNA will be delivered to Dr. Neil Renwick?s lab in Rockefeller University for small RNA sequencing.

In spite of the relatively high CD4 count seen in these patients, virtually all HIV-cHL cases are EBV positive.  We have previously evaluated a cohort of HIV-cHL in comparison to HIV negative cases to better understand their pathogenesis including the relationship of extent of the CD4 infiltrate in the lesional tissue.   We found that CD4 count in the lesional tissue did not necessarily correlate with HIV status, but was more closely aligned with EBV status.  In addition, expression of beta2microglobulin correlated with clinical course and outcome.  Additional, material has been sent to our collaborator at Duke where these HIV positive and HIV negative cHL are undergoing miRNA analysis.  

In this study we propose to further characterize the T cell infiltrate, particularly as it relates to HIV and/or EBV status, as well as further characterize the genetic and immunophenotypic characteristics of cHL in both HIV positive and HIV negative cases.  This would including expanding the cohort of patients to obtain more statistically significant numbers.  

1.	Additional TMAs would be generated including a replica of the previous WCMC cHL TMA, as well of new HIV positive and HIV negative cases.  
2.	These additional TMAs will be immunophenotyped for EBER, CD30, PAX5, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD68, CD163, GranzB, TIA1, FOXP3, beta2microglobulin, as done on the previous (Northwestern/Cook County Hospital TMAs).  
3.	All TMAs would be examined for T cell subset markers for TH1, TH2, TH17, Treg, Tfh as well as for BLIMP1 and BCL6, markers that are seen on additional subsets of T cells (BCL6 on Tfh; BLIMP1 on Th1, Th2, Th15 and Tregs and CD8+T cells).  Furthermore, as BLIMP1 in T cells is also interacts with XBP1 for cytokine secretion, immunostaining for XBP1 will also be requested. Potentially there will be double staining, depending on the findings

LGL is frequently associated with autoimmune disease and is thought to arise in the setting of chronic immune stimulation. Transient oligoclonal and monoclonal populations are very common and are difficult to distinguish from true malignancy. Many cases are indolent, but some require treatment with chemotherapy. Diagnostic criteria for LGL are controversial and are not well-defined. Establishment of diagnosis requires long follow-up to confirm persistence of the clone. Detection of TCR gamma gene rearrangement is routinely used but is not endorsed by the WHO Classification. In addition, there is no routine test to establish NK cell clonality. Recent studies have identified a somatic gain-of-function STAT3 mutation in 40-70% of LGL. Positive nuclear staining for phosphorylated STAT3 antibody in the tumor cells has been reported to correlate with presence of the mutation and was identified in bone marrow samples of two reported patients with LGL.
We propose to analyze a cohort of patients diagnosed with LGL in our institution during the last 10 years. We will undertake a detailed clinicopathologic analysis of the cases and correlate the findings with results of STAT3 immunohistochemical staining and TCR gamma gene rearrangement. STAT3 mutation status will be determined in Dr. Inghirami?s laboratory and will be used as the gold standard.

In the appropriate clinical settings such as symptomatic resolution with emollients and topical steroids and coexisting atopic dermatitic lesions elsewhere on the body, nipple eczema becomes a straightforward diagnosis.3-4 Clinical diagnostic conundrums are more frequent with unilateral eczematous nipples occurring as a solitary finding. Paget disease of the nipple shares similar findings, is typically unilateral and is associated with at least ductal carcinoma in situ.4 To definitively distinguish the two entities and other dermatoses such as clear cell acanthoma, psoriasis and lichen sclerosis, a nipple biopsy is warranted.
Nipple eczema is histologically distinct though not fully characterized in the literature. We have reviewed ten cases that share multiple overlapping features including psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia, spongiosis, granular cell layer diminution with parakeratosis, intraepithelial eosinophilia and lymphocytosis, and perivascular inflammatory infiltration within the superficial dermis. In our study, we will report the key clinical and histopathologic features of nipple eczema. We would like to further characterize the inflammatory infiltrate by studying the expression of IL-17, a marker that has been shown to be increased on allergen challenge secondary to the dysregulation and proliferation of Th1 and Th2 cells.4-6

Despite frequent expression of myeloid antigens, ETP-ALL does not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for AML or mixed-phenotype acute leukemia-T/myeloid (MPAL-T/M) by 2008 WHO classification. By current WHO classification, T lymphoblasts with more than 3% of neoplastic cells showing MPO expression (by cytochemistry) fulfill the requirement for myeloid lineage assignment and should thus be diagnosed as MPAL-T/M. T lymphoblasts with 2% of tumor cells showing MPO expression are considered as T-ALL (most likely ETP-ALL if other criteria are met). In clinical practice, the distinction between these diagnoses may be challenging especially due to arbitrary cut-off value. The biological significance of the distinction is also in question due to the arbitrary diagnostic criteria. The goal of the study is to further characterize the ETP-ALL and evaluate its relationship with acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage such as MPAL-T/M.  
The majority of the studies on ETP-ALL focus on pediatric patients. We plan to focus on non-pediatric samples.

The size mismatch between the recipient and the donor organ may lead to development of proteinuria due to hyperfiltration injury in the post-transplant period (3).  The pathology is referred to as pediatric donor glomerulopathy (PDG).  PDG may show a characteristic ultrastructural and histomorphologic appearance including glomerular mesangial hypercellularity, podocyte prominence within the urinary space, and glomerular basement membrane lamellation along the subepithelial surface (4,5).  We aim to study the clinicopathologic features of our kidney transplant biopsies from pediatric donors and to further characterize the pathologic process using immunoperoxidase markers which are variably lost (or overexpressed) in different types of podocyte injury: WT1, podocin, synaptopodin, Ki-67, and CK.  These markers are all either available on the clinical service or have been previously worked up by the TRP lab for use in previous projects (podocin, synaptopodin).  We have identified 25 patients with 37 biopsies of pediatric donor allografts that have had light microscopy, immunofluorescence and electron microscopic examinations performed on for clinical purposes.  We will also do the same stains on 10 control transplant biopsies from adult donors.  We believe this is an important study to further characterize the podocyte injury in these pediatric donor kidneys and also to translate the biopsy findings to the clinical manifestations and outcomes in the allograft recipients.

Determination of KRAS mutational status has become standard of care for patients with advanced CRC to identify those eligible for anti-EGFR therapy.   Activating mutations in KRAS result in resistance to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab; therefore these drugs are reserved for patients with wild-type KRAS.   Some patients, however, have a suboptimal response to anti-EGFR therapy despite lacking KRAS mutations.  HER2 amplification occurs 5-14% of patients with wild-type KRAS and has been proposed to account for anti-EGFR treatment failure in this subset.  Preliminary results from the HERACLES trial have shown combination therapy with anti-EGFR and anti-HER2 agents to be effective in these patients.  Given the therapeutic implication of HER2 amplification, it is likely that determination of HER2 status will become part of the standard work-up of advanced CRC.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical features and molecular profiles of KRAS wild-type/HER2 amplified CRCs in collaboration with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC).  To do this, we plan to identify 100 KRAS wild-type CRCs through review of the pathology database.  Screening for HER2 amplified cases will be performed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on whole tissue sections.

Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), an uncommon form of extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), is a potentially curable cancer. However, the 5-year survival rates for PCNSL are inferior to those achieved for other forms of extranodal NHL. An estimated 1,927 cases of PCNSL were diagnosed each year in the U.S. from 2004 to 2006 and the number of cases is expected to increase further with the aging of the U.S. population. The optimal treatment approach for newly diagnosed PCNSL patients has yet to be defined, partially due to the lack of data from prospective randomized trials.
Deferral of whole brain irradiation and use of chemotherapy alone in the newly diagnosed PCNSL patient population is a strategy used by an increasing number of clinicians. Primary central nervous system lymphomas exhibit a unique responsiveness to methotrexate compared to systemic lymphomas. High-dose methotrexate-based therapies currently represent the most effective regimen in this disease. A univariate analysis of a retrospective series of 226 patients diagnosed with PCNSL suggests that use of high-dose methotrexate is the only treatment-related factor. Treatment with regimens that included high-dose methotrexate had significantly better overall survival.
The combination of methotrexate, temozolomide, and rituximab (MTR) as induction chemotherapy has been utilized successfully in both the single center and the multicenter setting as induction therapy in PCNSL. In a single-center study MTR was administered as induction therapy to newly diagnosed or relapsed PCNSL patients with 10/10 and 6/6 responses, respectively. In a multicenter phase II study MTR was administered to 46 newly diagnosed PCNSL patients. In this latter study, 63% of patients achieved a complete response.
In the phase II study consolidation consisted of etoposide and cytarabine. This regimen has been used effectively as a salvage regimen for PCNSL patients. Good diffusion of cytarabine and etoposide in the CNS has been demonstrated. Regimens that include cytarabine are also associated with improved survival in PCNSL on univariate analysis. Neurotoxicity with high-dose cytarabine is preventable when doses are reduced in accordance with serum creatinine levels. This regimen is efficacious in patients with Burkitt lymphoma and initial CNS disease. Moreover, the combination of high-dose cytarabine plus etoposide appears to be feasible and safe in the multicenter setting. Moreover, this consolidation strategy was
associated with excellent 2-year progression-free survival (55%) and 2-year overall survival (71%).
Although the studies are relatively small and non-randomized, high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplant is associated with promising long-term OS results for PCNSL patients. The avoidance of whole brain irradiation appears to preserve cognitive function in long-term survivors. Demonstration this is superior to consolidation non-myeloablative chemotherapy could rapidly change the standard of care for the newly diagnosed PCNSL patient population under the age of 70.

To increase availability of renal allografts for transplantation, pediatric deceased donor kidneys have been successfully utilized, including in our center (1).  The kidneys come from children under the age of 6, some from donors less than 10 kg, and may either be transplanted en-bloc (2 kidneys simultaneously into 1 recipient) or as a single organ transplant into an adult recipient (1,2).  The size mismatch between the recipient and the donor organ may lead to development of proteinuria due to hyperfiltration injury in the post-transplant period (3).  The pathology is referred to as pediatric donor glomerulopathy (PDG).  PDG may show a characteristic ultrastructural and histomorphologic appearance including glomerular mesangial hypercellularity, podocyte prominence within the urinary space, and glomerular basement membrane lamellation along the subepithelial surface (4,5).  We aim to study the clinicopathologic features of our kidney transplant biopsies from pediatric donors and to further characterize the pathologic process using immunoperoxidase markers which are variably lost (or overexpressed) in different types of podocyte injury: WT1, podocin, Ki-67, and CK.  These markers are all either available on the clinical service or have been previously worked up by the TRP lab for use in previous projects (podocin).  We have identified 32 patients with 55 biopsies of pediatric donor allografts that have had light microscopy, immunofluorescence and electron microscopic examinations performed on for clinical purposes.  We aim to stain 1 biopsy from each patient (n=32). We believe this is an important study to further characterize the podocyte injury in these pediatric donor kidneys and also to translate the biopsy findings to the clinical manifestations and outcomes in the allograft recipients.

A majority of the current literature regarding angiomatosis is in the form of case reports or small (<5) case series.1-9  While the histopathologic features of angiomatosis have been described in such reports, a throughout and systematic evaluation of angiomatosis in a larger series would be of great utility.  Furthermore, little is known regarding the immunohistochemical profile of these lesions particularly in regard to the phenotype of these lesions (i.e., hemangioendothelial versus lymphangioendothelial).  Evaluation of a larger series would also provide insight into the presentation, clinicopathologic features and natural history of angiomatosis.    
     
The most important differential diagnosis for angiomatosis is low-grade angiosarcoma.  Both lesions demonstrate anastomosing vascular channels which are typically devoid of erythrocytes and demonstrate diffuse, perilobular growth.  Prior studies have shown that Ki-67 (MIB-1) is helpful tool in distinguishing other benign vascular tumors (i.e., hemangiomas) from angiosarcomas, with the latter typically show Ki-67 indices >20%.10  Currently there are no studies which have evaluated Ki-67 indices in angiomatosis and such a study would be of utility in the distinguishing angiomatosis from angiosarcoma.  The distinction between angiomatosis and angiosarcoma is of great importance given the prognostic implications and treatment.  Angiomatosis may be treated surgically with complete excision, while angiosarcomas require complete excision or mastectomy along with systemic therapy and/or radiation.  Furthermore, angiosarcomas have a poor prognosis with a propensity for distant metastases,11 whereas angiomatosis may locally recur but do not metastasize.5-7
     
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the expression of immunohistochemical markers in mammary angiomatosis.  We will also evaluate the key morphologic features, presentation, clinicopathologic features, and follow-up of the study patients, when available. Our aims are:

1.  Systematically evaluate distinguishing morphologic features of angiomatosis.

2.  Summarize the presentation, clinicopathologic features and follow-up of patients with angiomatosis.

3.  Analyze immunohistochemical expression of D2-40, CD31 and Ki-67 in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues from mammary angiomatosis.

For aim 2: Information regarding patient age, sex, presentation, size, location, and clinical follow-up will be obtained from the electronic medical record and summarized.

For aim 3: We will perform immunohistochemistry on whole tissue slides from mammary angiomatosis samples using the following antibodies:  D2-40, CD31 and Ki-67.

The new ASCO/CAP 2013 guidelines recommend that biomarker assays should be performed on every new recurrence and often in metastatic cases only cytologic material might be available. However, only limited data is available regarding the assessment of HER-2 status on cell block preparations. 

Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to study the concordance between IHC and FISH results of HER-2 in cases of metastatic breast carcinoma on cell block preparations. Secondary objectives include the study of inter-observer variability in the interpretation of HER-2 IHC on cell block preparations and the concordance between the HER-2 status of the metastasis versus the primary tumor. 

Methods: We have collected cases of metastatic breast carcinoma diagnosed on cell block preparation obtained from FNA for HER-2 assessment over 5 years (2010-2015). FISH will be performed with HER2/neu/CEP17 probes (Vysis/Abbott Molecular) 10 IHC 0/1+ and 10 IHC 3+ cases. Inter-observer variability will be studied by asking three pathologists to score the slides independently. Also, the HER-2 status on all the cases will be compared to that of the primary tumor. 

Outcome: This is to our knowledge the first study to investigate the correlation between IHC and FISH in the determination of HER-2 status of metastatic breast carcinoma on FNA-derived cell block preparations using the new ASCO/CAP 2013 guidelines. The results of this study will be valuable in the routine clinical practice of HER-2 status determination on cytologic specimens.",5,"vis2018","Admin approved - BH 1/8/16",1,10-DEC-15,"Budget Proposal TRP HER2 Project (TRP 14803)

The pathologic assessment of residual carcinoma following chemotherapy is critical for treatment planning. Patients who achieve pathologic complete response (pCR), defined as the absence of residual invasive carcinoma in the breast and lymph nodes (staged as ypT0N0), show better overall survival compared to those with residual disease. 
An uncommon scenario is the presence of residual carcinoma in the post-neoadjuvant specimen that is restricted to angiolymphatic channels without any identifiable stromal invasive carcinoma. This pattern has been referred to as ?pure intralymphatic carcinoma.? A single study of 6 patients showed that this pattern of residual disease was independently prognostic for having a higher risk of death, with 5 of 6 patients dying over a mean follow-up of less than 4 years [1]. Pure intralymphatic carcinoma is not recognized by AJCC or WHO for staging purposes and it is unclear how this pattern should be reported. This is important as many clinical trials use post-neoadjuvant pathologic staging as their primary endpoint. Clearly, additional studies are needed to further characterize this patient population and the clinical implications of finding pure intralymphatic carcinoma following chemotherapy. 
We plan to evaluate slides from approximately 300 post-neoadjuvant specimens which have been identified from a natural language search. We expect to find 6-10 cases of pure intralymphatic carcinoma, based on reports from the natural language search. For each specimen, residual cancer burden (RCB) scores and post-neoadjuvant pathologic staging will be recorded [2]. Clinical features, chemoadjuvant regimen, and outcomes of patients with pure intralymphatic carcinoma will be studed and compared with patients without residual invasive carcinoma (ypT0 or ypTis) as well as with patients with residual invasive carcinoma of similar size as the foci of lymphatic invasion. Other parameters including axillary lymph node status, hormone receptor expression, and HER2 status, will also be studied.
We are requesting TRP support for slide/block pulling, for H&E recuts, and for immunohistochemistry, if necessary. Estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), HER2, and Ki-67 immunostains will be performed on pure intralymphatic carcinoma specimens in which they were not previously performed. In cases where it is difficult to discern carcinoma in true lymphatic spaces from carcinoma with retraction artifact, D2-40 and CD31 immunostains will be performed.

ADDENDUM:
We would like to perform Ki67 immunohistochemistry on all resection specimens and core biopsies for which these slides are not available. We anticipate this to be about 150 cases. In addition we would like to cut unstained slides for additional studies at the time of cutting unstained slides for Ki67. The Ki67 data will serve as a stand-alone study and will also be necessary for additional studies that are based on other markers and H&E assessments of specific parameters. We are particularly interested in studying Ki67 in low-grade ER-positive invasive tumors, including invasive lobular carcinoma, as these are particularly problematic with regards to clinical decision making when residual tumor is present. Both manual scoring and image analysis using the Halo system will be performed on all cases.

Even though concurrent chemoradiation improves overall survival in patients with locally advanced NSCLC compared to sequential chemotherapy followed by radiation or thoracic radiation alone, more than 70% would die from recurrent disease. There is a significant need to improve the outcomes in patients with locally advanced NSCLC.
Nearly 10% of all patients with NSCLC diagnosed in the western hemisphere have mutations in the EGFR TK domain. The proportion of patients with EGFR TK mutation increases dramatically to 30%-50% in a group of patients with Asian ethnicity and in those who report no history of tobacco smoking. EGFR TK mutation positive NSCLC perhaps represents the most common molecularly defined subset of NSCLC. EGFR TK inhibitors produce striking response rates (70%-90%) and progression-free survival (12-13 months) in metastatic NSCLC in this subset. Even by conservative estimates, these numbers represent a 2 to 3-fold improvement over chemotherapy alone. Use of EGFR TK inhibitors in a selected group of patients with molecularly vulnerable disease has a high likelihood of improving the outcomes. Moreover, there is extensive experience with regard to the safety and tolerability in advanced disease setting alone, in combination with chemotherapy and in combination with thoracic radiation. ALK fusion gene is present in 3-4% of all patients with NSCLC but probably ~10% in adenocarcinoma of the lung, roughly at the same prevalence rate as EGFR TK mutations.

As previously described, by way of background: 
The first splenic IPT was described by Cotelingam and Jaffe (Inflammatory pseudotumor of the spleen. Am J Surg Pathol. 1984 May;8(5):375-80). The morphologic features showed a non-specific inflammatory or vascular origin, overlapping with sclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation (SANT) and IgG4 sclerotic proliferations. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, another diagnostic possibility, was excluded by negative staining for ALK-1.  
 The presence of a low grade variant (tumor) in spleen or liver was described by several authors. This was named IPT-like follicular dendritic cell tumor (Cheuk W et al. Inflammatory pseudotumor-like follicular dendritic cell tumor: a distinctive low-grade malignant intra-abdominal neoplasm with consistent Epstein-Barr virus association. Am J Surg Pathol. 2001 Jun;25(6):721-31.). This distinctive variant has been described as being limited to liver and spleen and is typically grossly a solitary nodule (>3.5 cm) with hemorrhagic appearance, and sometimes central necrosis. On histologic review the cells have bland spindle cell morphology and are often negative for FDC markers (CD21, CD23, CD35). This may cause ambiguity of diagnosis, however they characteristically show diffuse EBV positive staining.  This class of lesions are distinctive in their EBV positivity, indolent behavior, and characterstic spindle cell morphology. However they are poorly understood and little is known about their etiology. 
The goal of this project is to improve our understanding of the genetic lesions that may underlie the pathology of this interesting lesion. A recent publication evaluated the molecular mutational profile of FDC sarcomas (Griffin GK, et al.  Targeted genomic sequencing of follicular dendritic cell sarcoma reveals recurrent alterations in NF-êB regulatory genes. Mod Pathol. 2016 Jan;29(1):67-74.) We plan to perform augmented exome sequencing of the IPT-like follicular dendritic cell tumor and compare our findings with the literature.",12,"mik9095","Admin approved - BH 6/8/17 PI was updated to Dr. Kluk, not Dr. Orazi - BH 6/9/17

However, the OCP goes well beyond the 50 gene cancer panel in that it has the ability to identify not only 73 oncogenes, but also 49 copy number alterations (CNAs), 26 tumor suppressor genes, and 22 fusion driver genes.1 Importantly, during the development of the OCP gene panel, genes without near-term clinical actionability were excluded, making the panel highly relevant in the current era of precision medicine.1 The OCP is also directly aligned with the NCI-MATCH trial to identify patients who can be enrolled in different clinical trials.1,8 Given the clinical oncologic relevance, the OCP, while currently limited to research use only, is in the process of undergoing New York State validation for clinical use. Additionally, the OCP also has demonstrable utility in translational research and successfully recapitulated the findings of clinical researchers at Weill Cornell, among others, regarding molecular subtypes and alterations with specific histology in prostate carcinoma.1,2,3,4 
The utility of the OCP in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), a particularly aggressive variant of primary breast cancer, is not well established in the literature. While hormone receptor positive cancers (Luminal A and B subtypes) may respond to hormonal therapy and Her-2 amplified tumors may respond to trastuzumab, oncologists are often faced with limited targeted treatment options with TNBC and must turn instead to general cytotoxic chemotherapy. For this reason, potentially targetable mutations, copy alterations, and gene fusions are being increasingly investigated in the breast cancer research field. For instance, the secretory breast carcinoma (a subset of TNBC) is known to harbor the ETV6-NTRK3 gene fusion5, and is currently being investigated in a phase II clinical trial of the oral TRK inhibitor LOXO-1016. As another example, a phase I clinical copy number gains in FGFR2 in TNBC in patients who have failed standard therapy is currently also currently underway.7 Unlike the NGS 50 gene cancer panel using the Ion Torrent which would fail to identify patient who may be eligible for these trials, the OCP using the same Ion Torrent technology on the automated S5 platform, would identify potentially important fusion drivers, amplifications and copy number variants. 
The aim of our study is two-fold. We would like to validate the use of the OCP in TNBC, which will likely have meaningful clinical impact in the future in identifying potentially targetable mutations, copy number alterations, and gene fusions. We would also like to use the OCP to identify mutations in our TNBC patient population. From this, we hope to contribute to the growing body of literature on the molecular alterations in TNBC and possibly identify never-before described TNBC genetic findings.

However, up to 53% of patients in the Trastuzumab for Gastric Cancer (ToGA) trial were non-responders to trastuzumab despite proven HER2-positivity for reasons that are not currently well understood.  A Japanese group determined that phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) downregulation, which leads to activation of the PI3K/AKT anti-apoptotic pathway, decreases the clinical response to trastuzumab in HER2-positive tumors (Deguchi, Gastric Cancer 2016).  Furthermore, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1), which is known to be upregulated in up to 50% of gastric cancers, is associated with PTEN inactivation and escape from immune-mediated tumor cell death (Hamai, Cancer Res 2008; Jung, J Gastric Cancer 2012).  We hypothesize that increased ICAM1 expression leads to inhibition of tumor response to trastuzumab via activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway and immunologic escape.  In addition to ongoing in vitro experiments with cell lines to test this hypothesis, we propose a clinical correlation by co-staining archived paraffin blocks of gastric and gastro-esophageal junction adenocarcinomas for HER2 and ICAM1.  We will then perform retrospective chart review to identify clinical characteristics, tumor behavior, and response to trastuzumab in patients for whom samples are available.

The peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) are a diverse group of mature T-cell and natural killer (NK) cell neoplasms accounting for 10-15% of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) diagnoses in the United States.24-26 The number of diagnoses has increased nearly 3-fold over the past 2 decades.27 In the WHO classification, the diverse mature T-cell and NK-cell neoplasms are listed individually. The PTCL histologies include PTCL,NOS, angioimmunoblastic T-cell Lymphoma (AITL), anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALC) ALK positive and negative (the 3 most common histologies in the US), as well as the less common extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL), hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma, subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL).28,29 Therapy for the PTCLs is largely based on aggressive B-cell lymphoma regimens. Outcomes though are generally worse when compared to B-cell NHL with 5-year survival rates of 35-43% and for the rarer PTCLs 22%-24%.30 A recent analysis showed that the median time from initial diagnosis to relapse or progression after primary therapy is only 6.7 months
The choice of the 200 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W) as an appropriate dose for fixed dosing is based on simulations performed using the population PK model of pembrolizumab showing that the fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks will provide exposures that 1) are optimally consistent with those obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks, 2) will maintain individual patient exposures in the exposure range established in melanoma as associated with maximal efficacy response and 3) will maintain individual patients exposure in the exposure range established in melanoma that are well tolerated and safe.",5,"lymphoma","Admin approved - BH 4/17/17",1,13-APR-17,"Slides - stained from FFPE: $12 x 1 slide x 5 subjects = $60

","A phase I trial of ibrutinib plus PD 0332991 (palbociclib) in patients with previously treated mantle cell lymphoma","1403014853",,,,"Jiibril Palmer","646-962-9377","jip7006@med.cornell.edu",1,5327413501,"Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an incurable lymphoma that is characterized by overexpression of cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), which leads to dysregulation of the cell cycle and unrestrained proliferation. PD 0332991 (palbociclib) is an oral, highly selective and potent inhibitor of CDK4 and CDK6. Sustained inhibition of CDK4/CDK6 by PD 0332991 (palbociclib) induces prolonged early G1 cell cycle arrest (pG1) in all Rb-positive MCL tumor cells, regardless of the p53 status. Moreover, pG1 forces an imbalance in gene expression, thereby sensitizing tumor cells to killing by a partner drug in vitro and in vivo. In a phase 1b study in patients with previously treated MCL, PD 0332991 (palbociclib) was well tolerated and resulted in durable responses. A phase 1 trial of PD 0332991 (palbociclib) plus bortezomib confirmed the ability of PD 0332991 (palbociclib) to induce pG1 in all MCL cells. Immunohistochemistry performed on biopsies taken pre-treatment and after 8 days of PD 0332991 (palbociclib) demonstrated a significant decrease in pRb and Ki67 at the second time point. Clinically, the combination was well tolerated and appeared to have dose-dependent clinical activity. Ibrutinib is a well-tolerated, oral inhibitor of Bruton?s tyrosine kinase (BTK) with a single-agent response rate of ~65% in patients with previously treated MCL, with an estimated 12-month progression-free survival of ~50%. The molecular basis for resistance and response is unknown. Our preclinical data demonstrate that induction of pG1 by PD 0332991 (palbociclib) can inhibit MCL cell proliferation and sensitize MCL cells to killing by ibrutinib. We propose to study the safety and efficacy of PD 0332991 (palbociclib) plus ibrutinib in patients with previously treated MCL. In addition, we will evaluate the effects of the combination on the cell cycle and cell death in serial biopsies. Based on encouraging preclinical data, we believe that this therapeutic strategy will result in more significant and durable clinical responses to BTK inhibition in patients with MCL. Moreover, these studies will lay the groundwork for similar studies in other cancers.

Chronic liver disease and the consequences of end-stage liver disease are increasing globally
despite improved prevention and treatment of viral hepatitis. This is due to the emerging
epidemics of obesity and metabolic syndrome that are leading to an increased incidence of
NASH. Prevalence rates of hepatic steatosis or fatty liver, an entity that has been termed
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), range from 6% to 37% worldwide {Ong 2007,
Vernon 2011} with a recent pooled overall global prevalence of 25% reported {Younossi 2016}.
NASH, the form of NAFLD associated with increased liver-related mortality, affects between
approximately 30% of all patients with NAFLD {Ong 2007, Williams 2011, Younossi 2016}. In
the United States (US), it has been estimated that 2% to 5% of the population have NASH
{Vernon 2011}, which is equivalent to approximately 16 million adults. Furthermore, as NASH
is a manifestation of the metabolic syndrome, associated elevated cardiovascular risk factors
(e.g., atherosclerotic disease, cardiac arrhythmogenicity) likely coexist in patients with NASH
{Dietrich 2014, Faramawi 2008, Voulgari 2010}. NASH represents a significant and growing
unmet medical need for which there are no currently approved therapies.
NASH is primarily thought to occur as the result of the metabolic syndrome: the impact of
obesity, hepatic insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. Fatty liver, or simple steatosis, is not
sufficient to cause liver injury; it is the presence of inflammation and hepatocellular injury on the
background of steatosis that produces NASH and may result in the progression to cirrhosis and
its complications including end-stage liver disease. The ¡§2-hit¡¨ hypothesis of NASH suggests
that in the setting of steatosis and metabolic dysfunction, increased oxidative stress and the
generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) likely mediate the inflammatory changes in the
liver (steatohepatitis) with progressive liver fibrosis {Dowman 2010, Koek 2011, Rolo 2012,",5,"maf2062","Admin approved - BH 6/7/17",1,01-JUN-17,"",100,2,"sok9028@med.cornell.edu","Dr. sonal Kumar","SK",0,"",,,,,,""

It has considerable morphologic, immunophenotypic, molecular and clinical heterogeneity. For example, the activated B-cell subtype of DLBCL is characterized by constitutively active NF-kB pathway frequently caused by somatic mutations of key molecules regulating the pathway (e.g. CARD11, TRAF2 and TNFAIP3). Other DLBCLs are characterized by gene expression similarity to germinal center B-cells or preferential dependence on the mitochondria energy metabolism.  In addition, clinical behavior of DLBCL varies.  While 60% of the cases can be cured by conventional chemotherapy, the rest of them are refractory or will eventually relapse.  Thus, better clinical treatment of DLBCL is dependent on dissecting the molecular heterogeneity of DLBCL and identifying patient-specific actionable targets. We have recently been awarded a Specialized Center of Research Program (SCOR) grant entitled ?Targeting unmet clinical needs for B-cell lymphomas? by the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, As a Core leader of the grant, I would like to propose the construction of a DLBCL TMA for the investigators in the group as well as other investigators as well. This TMA will be invaluable for immunohistochemical analysis and validation of signaling pathways and biomarkers. To date, two investigators in the group will require this TMA for their studies on WNT pathway and histone methylation. The TMA will consist of at least 100 DLBCL cases selected from the pathology archive from the past 20 years, and will encompass DLBCL, NOS and specific subtypes of DLBCL.

This pathway is potentially targetable given the availability of an FDA-approved therapy (eg, Fingolimod) used to control lymphocyte circulation in some diseases (eg, Multiple Sclerosis).

Initial studies by Dr. Kluk have shown alternating expression profiles of S1P pathway components (receptors) in different physiological compartments in human lymph nodes using an established immmunohistochemical staining method.

Preliminary studies in mice by Dr. Sanchez (Dept of Pathology) have shown that several factors control expression of S1P pathway components. One of these factors appears to be non-coding RNA.

The purpose is to assess if there is a relationship between the expression patterns of specific S1P pathway components (receptors)and non-coding RNA in human and mouse tissues. 

The specific objective is to establish an in situ hybridization method to successfully assess the expression pattern of the non-coding RNA in human and mouse tissues. This work will complement ongoing studies in the Sanchez lab to understand the mechanism by which there is cross-talk between the S1P pathway components expression and non-coding RNA expression and will also complement ongoing work by Dr. Kluk regarding S1P pathway component expression patterns.

Immunohistochemical staining for HER2 is performed in all cases of invasive breast carcinoma in order to determine the status of HER expression whereas FISH for HER2 gene amplification is only performed in equivocal cases initially tested by immunohistochemistry (2+, on a scale of 0 to 3+).  Interpretation by immunohistochemistry is semiquantitative and suffers from high interobserver variability.  In a recent study from Soofi and Khoury, a discordant rate in the diagnosis of a breast lesion occurred 20% of the time (104 cases out of 502 total) and of those, 11% (11 of the 104 cases) were due to interpretation of HER2 [1]. The study highlight the needs for standardization of interpretation of HER2 immunohistochemical stain.

With the emerging availability of digital imaging and automated image analysis software, the use of automated image analysis to reduce interobserver variability and to standardize interpretation had been investigated.  Most recently, a study by Ayad et al. of 15 equivocal HER2 breast cancer cases demonstrated that computerized analysis with whole slide image (WSI) is highly sensitive and specific when compared to FISH in detecting HER2 status, more so than manual interpretation. Their study also showed a decrease in the number of cases being interpreted as equivocal when using computerized image analysis. However, given the small number of studied samples, the result of this study need to be further investigated [3]. Other previous studies have also explored the utility of automated analysis of HER2, however, these studies were done using tissue microarray and selected captured images instead of whole slide image, both of which are not practical for everyday pathology work flow. Their conclusions, however, demonstrated that automated image analysis of HER2 is either just as good as or better than manual interpretation with improved interobserver rate as well as decreased number of equivocal cases requiring additional FISH analysis [3, 4, 5]. Overall, variability in interpretation can be decreased using assisted digital imaging and theoretically improve concordance with FISH results (considered the gold standard) and thus, improve patient care.  
The main goal of this study is to evaluate HER2 expression in breast cancer using whole slide scanning image and INDICA© automated image analysis software and to compare the results with manual interpretation and FISH result. 
We will be studying 250 cases of breast cancer that were stained for HER2 by IHC and also have FISH results.  While a subset of our cases will be 0 or 3+ by IHC, the majority of them will have been reported as 1+ or 2+.  This is fortuitous for our project since equivocal cases are the cases that could benefit from ?more accurate? IHC interpretation.  

We will also be needing biostatistics support to assist with calculation of disconcordance rate between computerized image analysis and manual interpretation. ",8,"min9031","",0,22-JUL-15,"",,3,"min9031@nyp.org","sandra shin","mn",1,"",0,,,,,""

Traditionally, this determination has been made by immunohistochemical analysis of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR).  In recent years, multigene assays are being utilized by oncologists to help tailor patients? treatment plans.  Oncotype DX (Genomic Health, Redwood City, CA) is a commercial assay designed to assess tumor recurrence probability in node-negative, estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers which oncologists use to decide eligibility of adjuvant chemotherapy in tested patients. This multigene assay consisting of 21 genes including ER and PR uses a quantitative RT-qPCR based platform to test formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tumor tissue.  
The available literature shows a concordance of 93-100% concordance for ER IHC and RT-PCR.1-5 However, in a minority of cases, discordant results of ER status between IHC performed at the home institution and RT-PCR results of Oncotype DX are encountered.  This generates considerable concern among treating oncologists as their management decisions are heavily based on patients? hormone receptor (HR) status.  
Discrepant results between IHC and RT-qPCR may occur for a number of reasons including warm/cold ischemic time and fixation time (pre-analytical), varying sensitivities of antibody clones used for IHC and varying tumor blocks used for testing (analytical), and intratumoral heterogeneity.6-9 Interestingly, studies evaluating HR status discrepancy between IHC and RT-qPCR methods have relied solely on the RT-qPCR results generated by the Oncotype DX assay on the resection specimen1-5.
At Cornell, ER status is determined by IHC which is performed on the core needle biopsy specimen and not repeated on the subsequent excisional biopsy material as per the current ASCO/CAP guidelines.  If a clinician requests Oncotype DX testing, a representative tumor block from the excisional specimen is selected.  Although using different tissue blocks of the same tumor for IHC and RT-PCR may lead to discordant results, an initial survey of such incidences has revealed a high concordance rate of 96.4% at our institution.  This is in line with reported rates of other institutions who similarly use different tumor blocks for IHC and RT-PCR (via Oncotype DX).  In our cases, a total of 13 were identified as discordant.  
The goal of this study is to identify the reason(s) behind discordance in these 13 cases using a two pronged approach.  First, RT-PCR will be performed on the core biopsy tumor block used for IHC evaluation of ER and PR.  If this result differs from that reported by Oncotype DX (using the excisional biopsy tumor block), we will further investigate by repeating RT-PCR on the excisional biopsy tumor block used for Oncotype testing.  Results of this arm of the study may reveal pre-analytical causes for this discrepancy in some cases.  Second, several antibody clones will be used to re-evaluate the IHC result generated from the core needle biopsy specimen and also IHC will be performed on the excisional biopsy tumor block used for Oncotype analysis.  These will be compared and may reveal analytical sources of discordance.  If all possibilities have been exhausted, the presence of intratumoral heterogeneity will be considered.",12,"joa9097","Admin approved - BH 7/24/15",1,23-JUL-15,"Budget:

Patients reported to have this histologic finding are few in number and juvenile ADH as a clinicopathologic entity remains largely undercharacterized. The first and only case series was described by Eliasen et al. in 1992, comprising a total of nine female patients ranging in age from 18 to 26 years (mean 21).1 Five patients presented with breast hypertrophy and four patients presented with a mass. A literature search yields two additional case reports of a 16-year-old and 24-year-old with ADH by Johnson et al.2  

Juvenile ADH is not grossly evident and found incidentally during histologic examination of reduction mammoplasty specimens. The proliferation is often focal, juxtaposed to histologically unremarkable ducts and exhibits micropapillary or cribriform architecture. Myoepithelial cells are present, though can occur discontinuously. 3 The long term follow-up of the 1992 case series ranged from 5 ? 68 months (mean 39) and none of the patients developed carcinoma.1 It was emphasized in this series that a longer follow-up period would be necessary to adequately correlate with the risk of developing breast carcinoma in these patients. 

We have identified over ten cases of juvenile ADH in our breast consultation and in-house surgical pathology files from 1999-2016. Our study goals are to further characterize this entity by clinical, morphologic and immunohistochemical means.  Long term follow-up and other pertinent clinical history will be obtained.   In addition to evaluating routine clinicopathologic parameters, immunohistochemical studies will be performed, namely CK5/6 and ER.  These two stains are currently utilized in diagnostic breast pathology to discern between florid ductal hyperplasia and ADH or ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS) based on different patterns of positivity.  It would be of great interest to evaluate whether juvenile ADH stains similarly to adult ADH and if not, would suggest that juvenile ADH may be a misnomer and should not be considered a ?high risk? lesion requiring close clinical surveillance.

Immunohistochemical staining for HER2 is performed in all cases of invasive breast carcinoma in order to determine the status of HER expression whereas FISH for HER2 gene amplification is only performed in equivocal cases initially tested by immunohistochemistry (2+, on a scale of 0 to 3+).  Interpretation by immunohistochemistry is semiquantitative and suffers from high interobserver variability.  In a recent study from Soofi and Khoury, a discordant rate in the diagnosis of a breast lesion occurred 20% of the time (104 cases out of 502 total) and of those, 11% (11 of the 104 cases) were due to interpretation of HER2 [1]. The study highlight the need for standardization of interpretation of HER2 immunohistochemical stain.

With the emerging availability of digital imaging and automated image analysis software, the use of automated image analysis to reduce interobserver variability and to standardize interpretation had been investigated.  Most recently, a study by Ayad et al. of 15 equivocal HER2 breast cancer cases demonstrated that computerized analysis with whole slide image (WSI) is highly sensitive and specific when compared to FISH in detecting HER2 status, more so than manual interpretation. Their study also showed a decrease in the number of cases being interpreted as equivocal when using computerized image analysis. However, given the small number of studied samples, the result of this study need to be further investigated [3]. Other previous studies have also explored the utility of automated analysis of HER2, however, these studies were done using tissue microarray and selected captured images instead of whole slide image, both of which are not practical for everyday pathology work flow. Their conclusions, however, demonstrated that automated image analysis of HER2 is either just as good as or better than manual interpretation with improved interobserver rate as well as decreased number of equivocal cases requiring additional FISH analysis [3, 4, 5]. Overall, variability in interpretation can be decreased using assisted digital imaging and theoretically improve concordance with FISH results (considered the gold standard) and thus, improve patient care.  
The main goal of this study is to evaluate HER2 expression in breast cancer using whole slide scanning image and INDICA© automated image analysis software and to compare the results with manual interpretation and FISH result. 
We will be studying 250 cases of breast cancer that were stained for HER2 by IHC and also have FISH results.  While a subset of our cases will be 0 or 3+ by IHC, the majority of them will have been reported as 1+ or 2+.  This is fortuitous for our project since equivocal cases are the cases that could benefit from ?more accurate? IHC interpretation.  

For our budget, we will be scanning 250 slides with the Aperio scanning system at 20X costing 20$ per slide which totals to approximately $5000 for the study.

By combining RNAi loss-of-function screens with system biology interactome models, we completed a genome-wide screen searching for gene/pathways that are essential for the survival of ErbB2 overexpressing breast tumor cells but dispensable for normal cells (synthetic lethal interactions). We identified that the JAK/STAT3 pathway is activated in HER2+ breast cancer and that blocking this pathway strongly reduces the viability of HER2+ cells.  During the transformation mediated by overexpression of the oncogene ErbB2, we hypothesize that breast cancer cells become addicted to the activation of Stat3. Disruption of the pathway defined by the signaling 'IL6-JAK/STAT3-downstream targets' compromises the viability of ErbB2+ cancer cells without affecting non-transformed ones.

These disorders have both distinct and overlapping pathologic and clinical characteristics but their pathogenesis remains incompletely understood. Both of these disorders can lead to chronic colitis and are risk factors for developing colorectal cancer (CRC). CRC is the fourth most frequently diagnosed cancer and represents the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Current treatment options for these disease states are still lacking and unsatisfactory. A clearer understanding of the biology underlying colitis and colitis-related CRC should provide the rationale for improved therapies. Bioactive lipids represent a class of molecules that have large numbers of biological effects in the normal and pathological states. Sphingosine-1-phoshate (S1P) is one such mediator that controls immune cell trafficking as well as vascular function through interactions with its receptor S1P1. Both immune cell flux and angiogenesis are important features of IBD however the direct role of S1P in IBD is not well understood.

A Pivotal Multicenter Trial of Moxetumomab Pasudotox in Relapsed/Refractory Hairy Cell Leukemia","1510016705",11-MAY-16,31-DEC-20,12-MAY-16,"Tatyana Jean, MPH","646-962-9440","taj7005@med.cornell.edu",1,56580085,"This is a multicenter, single-arm study of moxetumomab pasudotox in patients with relapsed or refractory hairy cell leukemia.
Seventy- seven patients will be enrolled to receive 40 &#956;g/kg moxetumomab pasudotox, intravenous (IV) on Days 1, 3 and 5 of each 28 day cycle for a maximum of 6 cycles or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity occurs, the subject begins alternate therapy, or documented CR (for subjects who have no assessable minimal residual disease and not to exceed 6 cycles). If &#8804; 2 of the first 25 patients do not achieve durable CR, no additional patients will be accrued.

The primary endpoint is to determine the durable complete response (CR) rate of moxetumomab pasudotox with a minimum duration of >180 days. A durable CR will be defined as one in which hematologic remission (HR), namely the blood counts required for CR, are maintained for >180 days. Disease assessments for determining CR include bone marrow examination, cross-sectional imaging, and peripheral blood evaluation. Recurrent sustained (non-transient) cytopenias, particularly during the first 6
months of CR, will prompt a repeat bone marrow study to confirm relapse. The durable CR rate and its 95% confidence interval (CI) will be constructed using the exact probability method (Clopper-Pearson exact interval) in the Intent-to-Treat population. With 77 patients enrolled, there will be 90% power to detect a difference between 28%
and 13% (expected CR rate from best alternative non-chemotherapy treatment,
rituximab) durable CR rates using a 2-sided significance level of 0.05.
The overall estimated accrual is 80 to allow for a small screen-failure rate.

The primary objective of this study is to determine the rate of durable complete response (CR) in multiply relapsed HCL with moxetumomab pasudotox. To meet the primary endpoint, patients will need to meet standard criteria for CR by analysis of blood, bone marrow and imaging, and maintain a hematologic remission (HR), namely the blood counts needed for CR, for >180 days.

Secondary objectives include determining the overall response rate (ORR), progression free survival (PFS), time to treatment failure (TTF), duration of responses (CR and partial response [PR]), confirming tolerability and safety, and evaluating immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics of moxetumomab pasudotox.",5,"leukemia","Admin approved - BH 5/12/16",1,09-MAY-16,"",300,2,"sal9053@med.cornell.edu","Sangmin Lee, MD","SL",0,"",,,,,,""

As of now, treatment options for ICC include surgery and chemotherapy; however, no procedure or drug has been especially successful in producing a durable clinical response in this patient population. An exciting new area of study across various malignancies is that of the immune-checkpoint blockade antibodies, including anti-PDL1. The current literature supports the use of these drugs in malignancies with high mutation burden, such as colorectal carcinoma with microsatellite instability or non-small cell lung carcinoma in smokers. The clinical response to the drug does not appear to depend solely on the genetics of the malignancy. Some malignancies with a relatively low mutational burden, such as renal cell carcinoma, may respond to anti-PD-L1 because of the host response to the tumor. Studies in breast, melanoma, and colorectal carcinoma are investigating the host inflammatory infiltrate surrounding the tumor and how it may directly impact tumor growth. Other immune checkpoint inhibitors identified through these studies and validated in cell cultures and animal models has created new excitement for potential combination immunotherapy in certain patient populations.

Currently, the above studies have not specifically included patients with ICC. In fact, the incidence of microsatellite instability is known in pancreatic, ampullary, and extrahepatic adenocarcinoma, but not in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Additionally, full characterization of the immune response to ICC has not been performed. We propose a study of ICC resection specimens to determine MMR/MSI status and to characterize host inflammatory response in this tumor type.

Tumor secreted factors have long been recognized as important mediators of the brain metastatic cascade, however, the action of these molecules does not fully explain the complex process of brain metastasis suggesting a contribution from other players. The ?missing messengers? in brain metastasis may be a class of small microvesicles known as exosomes. Using a combination of in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro systems, we have been exploring the potential role of tumor-secreted exosomes in brain metastasis formation. Given our published data demonstrating the role of tumor-derived exosome protein cargo in metastasis (Peinado, H. et al, 2012; Costa-Silva, B. et al, 2015; Hoshino, A. et al 2015), we decided to characterize the proteomic profile of brain tropic cancer cell-derived exosomes by quantitative mass spectrometry. From this study we have identified exosomal KIAA1199 as a brain metastatic-specific protein. Also, we identified endothelial cells as the main cell in the brain interacting with tumor-derived exosomes and showed that tumor-derived exosomes have the ability to compromise the blood brain barrier using in vivo mouse models. We propose with this project to validate the association of KIAA1199 with metastasis to the brain using patient samples of brain metastasis. We aim to characterize the expression of this protein, and others related to it, in order to provide novel insight into the complexity of the brain metastatic process and potentially open new avenues for targeted therapies.

Treatment assignment will be stratified by ECOG 0 or 1, geographic region (Latin America or other participating countries), and primary tumor site (gastric or GEJ). 
Analysis Methods: The primary efficacy analysis set will be intent-to-treat (ITT). The ITT analysis set includes all randomized subjects
and will be analyzed according to treatment assigned. The Kaplan-Meier method and stratified log-rank test will be used to compare the 2 treatment groups for OS and PFS. A Cox proportional hazard model will be used to estimate the hazard ratio and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). For the analysis of ORR, a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel
(CMH) Chi-square test will be performed to compare the 2 treatment groups. In general, count and percent of subjects will summarize categorical and ordinal data. Mean, standard deviation, minimum, quartiles, median and maximum will summarize continuous data.
Interim Analysis: Two interim analyses are planned: the futility interim will be performed at 33.3% information and the efficacy interim
at 66.7% information. The final analysis will occur when 286 OS events have been observed. The Lan-DeMets approach with O'Brien-Fleming type alpha spending function will be used for efficacy data monitoring. The stopping boundaries at each analysis time are provided in the table below. Sample Size: Assuming a median OS time for the mFOLFOX6 + placebo group of 11.5 months, 286 events are needed to detect a
hazard ratio (HR) of 0.70 with 85% power at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05.

As the targeted
number of deaths is large (~286), if the null hypothesis of the primary end point of OS is rejected, it will convincingly demonstrate clinical treatment effect and would provide a narrow confidence interval. Based on the number of deaths and the assumed treatment effect on OS in the protocol, the expected 95% confidence interval on the HR of OS between the 2 treatment groups is ~ (0.627, 0.996). At the time of final analysis and assuming OS is significant, PFS will be tested at one-sided type I error of 0.016. Assuming that the hazard ratio in PFS is 0.7, which is expected to be on par or better than the treatment effect in OS, and that median PFS in control is 9 months, a sample size of

Constant immune activation by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), immunocompromised state, and superimposed viral infections like Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human herpesvrius-8 (HHV-8) are thought to play a key role in the development of AR-NHLs. However, the underlying molecular pathogenesis of AR-NHLs is largely unknown. Moreover, despite the success of combined-antiretroviral therapy (c-ART), HIV+ patients continue to have a markedly increased risk of developing AR-NHLs and a poorer outcome compared to non-HIV+ patients. Therefore, understanding the underlying mechanisms of the development of AR-NHLs is critical for prevention and treatment for this population.  

Research Design: We aim to understand the molecular alterations that result in the development of AR-NHLs. We have identified serial biopsies of lymphoid tissue from twenty HIV+ individuals who go on to develop AR-NHLs. From each patient, we have 2-3 serial biopsies, which include pre-lymphoma tissue and lymphoma positive biopsy. The cohort includes patients who developed diffuse aggressive lymphomas including diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Burkitt lymphoma, plasmablastic lymphoma, etc. 
Through whole exome sequencing of lymphomas, we will determine mutations therein. For cases in which multiple biopsies of a given lymphoma for the same patient are available, we will sequence the serial biopsies to determine clonal evolution of the neoplasms.  (We will use biopsies performed for other purposes, e.g. from the GI tract, for the germline control.)
We will also perform deep sequencing of the VDJ region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) of pre-lymphoma and lymphoma tissue to determine the clonal population within the benign lymphoid tissue that transformed into lymphoma. If the clonal population within the reactive tissue is successfully identified, ultra-deep sequencing of the reactive lymphoid tissue will be performed for specific mutations identified in the lymphoma. In this way, we will be able to separate in the driver mutations that caused the malignant transformation from bystander mutations.",5,"sbarouk","Admin approved - BH 6/20/16",1,20-JUN-16,"80 blocks x $10/retrieval = $800

Colorectal cancer in IBD is now recognized to follow inflammation-dysplasia-cancer sequence.  Unlike sporadic colorectal cancer, inflammation plays an important role in the carcinogenesis in IBD cancer.  There are some specific features related to colorectal cancer in IBD patients.  Macroscopically, these cancers tend to be poorly demarcated, irregular and multifocal and are more heterogeneous in appearance as flat, ulcers, strictures and polyps. Histologically, mucinous adenocarcinoma, signet ring cell carcinoma and extremely well-differentiated adenocarcinoma have a higher representation compared to sporadic cancer.  Current studies on IBD focus on grading of dysplasia and their macroscopic and prognostic correlation.  Little has been done on histologic classification of IBD related dysplasia.  We recognized from our practice that IBD related dysplasia has specific characteristics different from sporadic dysplasia such as acquiring more goblet cells which are consistent with high prevalence of cancer with mucinous feature in IBD related colorectal carcinoma.  We propose that IBD induced dysplasia has some histologic features that are distinct from sporadic adenoma.  Histologic characterization of the IBD related dysplasia will add more insight in understanding of IBD related dysplasia and might play a role as a prognostic indicator of IBD related colorectal cancer.
 
Method: IBD cases with dysplasia in the past 10 years will be pulled to characterize dysplasia according to macroscopic morphology (flap/polypoid), location (right side/left side), grading of dysplasia (low/high), number and location of goblet cells among the dysplasia, intensity of inflammation in the background colon(chronic/acute) etc.  Statistical analysis is used to determine the significance of this characterization.",5,"dox9002","Admin approved - BH 7/18/16",1,15-JUL-16,"Slides retrieval for 300 cases:

Molecular imaging is a growing field in diagnostic and therapeutic medicine. There is a need for new and improved imaging agents to accurately diagnose and differentiate diseases. Proper disease differentiation will ultimately lead to a better treatment plan and will potentially eliminate painful procedures (e.g. cancer biopsy). New and improved treatment agents are also needed (e.g. cancer), in order to maximize treatment output while minimizing side effects. Potential imaging agents need to be tested in animal models because disease allocation/regression studies and general biodistribution needs to be obtained.

Most imaging probes are designed to detect tumors. They interact with specific tumor markers, which could be a receptor, a surface ligand, a biomarker or an enzyme, and deposit at the tumor area, resulting in a contrast. These types of probes are suitable for early tumor detection. There are also imaging probes that are designed to sense therapeutic response. To validate these probes, animal with tumors will be imaged prior to treatment and post treatment. Standard chemotherapeutic agents like doxorubicin or paclitaxel will be used to trigger the tumor response. And then the images will be acquired to monitor the change in the tumor microenvironment. These types of probes are suitable for patient selection and guiding therapeutic treatment.

The goal of the treatment imaging studies is not to find a therapeutic agent, but to identify potential imaging agents to report early treatment response. We are interested in a sensitive imaging agent to report molecular changes at an early time point, thus the tumor bearing animals will be treated with standard chemotherapeutic agent for a short period of time, up to a week, and then followed with a developed imaging agent.",5,"MI3","Admin approved - BH 6/3/16

While TP53 mutations occur early, even before definite dysplasia, CAC is a later event, suggesting that subsequent genetic alterations are required for the development of carcinoma.  In contrast, premalignant polyps in non-colitis associated CRC are commonly associated with early APC mutations, with ensuing disruption of the WNT signaling pathway.  These data suggest that the progression to malignancy in CAC may differ significantly. At the time of diagnosis of carcinoma, many patients with CAC undergo a complete colectomy for primary prevention.  As a result, for many cases, we have pathologic material for the primary carcinoma and separate dysplastic lesions.  In this aim, we will evaluate the genetic alterations in paired dysplastic only versus dysplasia with associated carcinoma from the same patient to study the genetic changes that distinguish non-malignant dysplasia, both high and low grade, from invasive carcinoma.  We will sample the area adjacent to the CAC to evaluate, using immunohistochemistry, TP53 mutation status and stability in the region of the carcinoma, as secondary events may lead to p53 stabilization during tumor progression, which is required for p53 gain-of-function2.  We hypothesize that we will identify candidate ?second hits? in carcinoma that, in association with TP53 mutation, lead to invasive cancer.  We will further distinguish the common genetic alterations of premalignant dysplastic lesions in colitis patients from premalignant adenomatous polyps in non-colitis patients. We will perform whole exome sequencing (WES) on ten dysplasia-carcinoma pairs to identify additional candidate drivers, and, as a control, in ten adenomatous polyps (>1 cm in size) from non-IBD patients (excluding samples from patients with inherited genetic disorders including Lynch and FAP). We will obtain specimens of dysplasia and carcinoma for 10 IBD patients in year one, and 10 control non-IBD adenomas in year 1, and perform WES in the latter half of year 1 and in year 2. We will have completed the analysis of the WES data by the end of year 2. The WES of CAC in Aim 3 will compliment the NGS data of CAC in Aim 1, and may identify candidate biomarkers that could distinguish dysplatic lesions with a high risk for invasive cancer versus those with a low risk, for future testing. The WES of both dysplasia and CAC will help inform Aim 2.

This clinical trial is for men and women with Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) who were previously treated for this disease and who failed ibrutinib treatment or were unable to tolerate ibrutinib treatment.
?	While treatment of MCL with ibrutinib has yielded promising efficacy, clinicians and researchers are reporting the development of ibrutinib resistance.  Clinically, ibrutinib resistance leaves MCL patients without an established recourse for further treatment. Offering a treatment targeting a different pathway provides an opportunity to fulfill an unmet medical need in this patient population. In addition, some patients are unable to tolerate ibrutinib treatment, leaving them without an established therapeutic option after first-line treatment failure.
?	This is a single-arm, open-label Phase IIa study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of copanlisib monotherapy in patients with MCL who failed ibrutinib treatment or were unable to tolerate ibrutinib. Patients will receive copanlisib IV infusion at a starting dose of 60 mg as single agent on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-day treatment cycle. Patients will continue on treatment as long as they are responding to therapy and not experiencing unacceptable side effects. All patients, except for patients who object to follow-up data collection, will be followed for overall survival at least every 3 months during the survival follow-up period until death or until the end of study, whichever occurs first.

Subjects will be required to provide a tumor sample, to be evaluated at a central laboratory, for analysis of immune-related gene expression profile (GEP) for response prediction for

Subjects will be stratified by tumor histology and by geographic region (See Section 5.4 for stratification). The overall study enrollment is driven by the number of subjects with GEP high tumors (n =

If the prevalence of GEP high is 60%, it is estimated that approximately a total of 600 all comers will be enrolled.

Ligation of PD-L1 with PD-1 inhibits T-cell proliferation, cytokine production, and cytolytic activity, leading to the functional inactivation or exhaustion of T cells. Atezolizumab targets PD-L1 and inhibits its interaction with PD-1 and B7.1. Elevated PD-L1 expression is associated with a poor prognosis in NSCLC.

The pathogenesis of these lesions is unclear, and it is debated whether they are infectious, autoimmune, or neoplastic in etiology. Histologically these lesions consist of a mixture of polytypic plasma cells, lymphocytes, and histiocytes. 
The first splenic IPT was described by Cotelingam and Jaffe (Inflammatory pseudotumor of the spleen. Am J Surg Pathol. 1984 May;8(5):375-80). The morphologic features showed a non-specific inflammatory or vascular origin, overlapping with sclerosing angiomatoid nodular transformation (SANT) and IgG4 sclerotic proliferations. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, another diagnostic possibility, was excluded by negative staining for ALK-1.  
Follicular dendritic cell (FDC) sarcoma is a rare neoplasm with <200 published cases, that predominantly affect women, occurring in lymph nodes and multiple extranodal sites. They are characterized by aggressive behavior, and can be rapidly fatal, presenting with large size, intraabdominal location, and high grade, while others show local recurrence.  The presence of a low grade variant (tumor) in spleen or liver was described by several authors. This was named IPT-like follicular dendritic cell tumor (Cheuk W et al. Inflammatory pseudotumor-like follicular dendritic cell tumor: a distinctive low-grade malignant intra-abdominal neoplasm with consistent Epstein-Barr virus association. Am J Surg Pathol. 2001 Jun;25(6):721-31.). This distinctive variant has been described as being limited to liver and spleen and is typically grossly a solitary nodule (>3.5 cm) with hemorrhagic appearance, and sometimes central necrosis. On histologic review the cells have bland spindle cell morphology and are often negative for FDC markers (CD21, CD23, CD35). This may cause ambiguity of diagnosis, however they characteristically show diffuse EBV positive staining. Two cases seen in-house at NYP/WCM and others sporadically reported, have shown SMA expression. These two cases show EBV positivity in virtually all neoplastic spindle cells and are excellent examples of this proposed entity. In comparison, the infiltrating inflammatory cells are EBV negative.  This class of lesions are distinctive in their EBV positivity, indolent behavior, and characterstic spindle cell morphology. However they are poorly understood and little is known about their etiology. 
The goal of this project is to clarify the cell of origin for this interesting indolent lesion and attempt to understand whether a biological difference between these lesions and FDC sarcoma exists. A recent publication evaluated the molecular mutational profile of FDC sarcomas (Griffin GK, et al.  Targeted genomic sequencing of follicular dendritic cell sarcoma reveals recurrent alterations in NF-&#954;B regulatory genes. Mod Pathol. 2016 Jan;29(1):67-74.) We plan to perform augmented exome sequencing of the IPT-like follicular dendritic cell tumor and compare our findings with the literature. 
Other than the 2 cases identified in-house, we have collaborated with Dr. Daniel Arber at Stanford, and an additional 8 cases will be added to the study. Prior to obtaining unstained sections for DNA extraction, H&E and EBER needs to performed on each of the cases submitted from Stanford to identify the lesional and normal tissue for DNA extraction from each.

One prospect being explored in other solid tumors, is targeting the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. Adverse conditions in tumors such as hypoxia, nutrient starvation and reactive oxygen species disrupt protein folding, inducing ER stress. The most evolutionarily conserved pathway by which this insult is alleviated is the IRE1&#945;-XBP1 axis, which increases the expression of protein folding and quality control genes. Previous work has demonstrated that several cancers utilize this pathway to promote tumorigenesis, progression and metastasis. A preliminary analysis of a tissue microarray containing 304 human NSCLC samples, of indeterminate mutational status found that 254 demonstrated at some positivity and >50% were strongly positive for the active isoform of XBP1. Given these preliminary findings, we hypothesize that the abnormal activation of the IRE1&#945;-XBP1 axis may influence KRAS NSCLC tumorigenesis and serve as a potential novel avenue for the treatment of NSCLC. We propose to evaluate XBP1 expression in a larger cohort of patients with defined mutational status and associated clinicopathologic features, to evaluate whether aberrant IRE1a-XBP1 signaling is associated with KRAS driven NSCLC pathogenesis. The TMAs that we are proposing to utilize contain samples from 500 patients, allowing us to properly evaluate any identified correlations.

Therefore, there is a need to find treatments that work for patients with sub-type ABC DLBCL. 
The purpose of this study is to directly compare any good and bad effects of using an oral medication, ibrutinib, along with an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AutoHCT). Ibrutinib is already FDA-approved for use in patients with other types of cancers, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, and Waldenstrom?s Macroglobulinemia. Though ibrutinib is FDA approved for use in patients with other types of cancer, it is investigational for this study. The researchers want to know if adding ibrutinib to the usual chemotherapy given with AutoHCT could prevent your lymphoma from returning in the future. However, addition of this medication could also cause side effects. This study will allow the researchers to know whether this different approach is better, the same, or worse than the usual approach.

Our lab has previously reported that IRF4, a transcription factor critically important for the development and activation of the immune system, is phosphorylated by ROCK2 during Th17 differentiation and that this phosphorylation augments the ability of IRF4 to bind the IL17 and IL21 promoters, driving expression of these effector cytokines. Given the essential roles of IRF4 in B cell physiology and pathophysiology, we are examining whether the ROCKs control IRF4 activity in the ABC subtype of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), a particularly aggressive malignancy that depends on IRF4 activity for survival. In our efforts to delineate this axis and to assess the more global roles of the ROCKs in regulating DLBCL biology, we are taking multiple approaches using both in vitro and in vivo models. We have found that ROCK2 is highly activated in ABC-DLBCL cell lines and that ROCK2 activity controls a distinct transcriptional program in these cells. For this portion of the project, we would like to complement our in vitro findings by assessing ROCK activity in primary DLBCL tumors.

The human vitreous humor has no known function and is often therapeutically removed.  Our hypothesis is that the normal human vitreous is biologically active; contains an endogenous scaffold-based signaling system of exosomes that contain genes and proteins that travels short and long distances to deliver their cargo to distant cells; and when dysregulated this system stimulates and directs pathologic growths in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Our preliminary studies demonstrate that bovine and human vitreous humor contains a dense network of millions of extracellular exosomes. These exosomes are produced, at least in part, by the ciliary body and contain a cargo with a diverse proteome and non-coding RNAs. We propose the vitreous can be biopsied and specimens used for comparative gene expression profiling for retinal diseases. The goals of this project are the following; 1) to demonstrate that the normal vitreous humor contains an endogenous inter-cellular exosome communication system and 2) characterize the role of vitreous exosomes in patient samples of diabetic retinopathy and age-matched controls. In this study we will challenge the dogma that human vitreous humor is biologically inactive.  

Determining the spatial localization of vitreous exosomes: We will determine the spatial localization of exosomes in human eyes using exosome specific markers and immunohistochemistry (IHC). We will examine vitreous cortex (which is attached to the retina/pars plana) in fresh frozen tissue sections of human post-mortem eyes (control and diabetic, n = 6). Based on the proteomic data in the preliminary studies, we know that specific exosome markers are enriched the ultra-centrifuged purified vitreous exosome fractions. We will use antibodies targeting anti-CD-9, anti-HSP-90, and anti-Annexin A2 proteins and conduct immunohistochemistry to determine the distribution of exosomes in the vitreous base. We will obtain post-mortem human eyes (The Eye-Bank for Sight Restoration, New York, NY) and whole eyes will be mounted in a Cryomold, immediately serial sectioned from 5 to 40 &#956;m with a cryostat (Leica) and mounted on slides. We will examine serial sections from the lateral rectus muscle to the midline to visualize all tissues (retina, vitreous pars plans, iris, ciliary body, ect.) for staining of exosomes (n=6). We will conduct H & E staining in serial sections to illustrate the anatomy of the eye. Our preliminary data shows that several microRNAs are enriched in the human vitreous. Therefore we will use specific miRNA probes (locked nucleic acid, LNA) to target and label exosome miRNAs and image the sections using modified fluorescent in situ hybridization procedure that we developed in Tuschl Lab.

Emerging immunotherapies are the most attractive anti-cancer intervention since the development of chemotherapy, hence there is an urgent need to identify new immune-based biomarkers associated with ovarian cancer progression and resistance to therapy.

Aggressive tumors thrive under adverse conditions by adjusting their protein folding capacity via the ER stress response pathway, the most conserved arm of which is the IRE1&#61537;-XBP1 pathway.  Sustained XBP1 activation has been shown to drive malignant progression by promoting cancer cell survival, chemoresistance and metastatic capacity. Tumor-infiltrating T-cells and dendritic cells in human ovarian cancer specimens demonstrate robust XBP1 overactivation, which correlates with reduced T cell infiltration and diminished capacity of tumor-reactive T cells to express tumoricidal IFN&#61543;. Additionally, in unpublished data, conditional gene-deficient mice lacking XBP1 in T-cells demonstrated delayed cancer progression, enhanced anti-tumor immune responses and increased overall survival compared with their WT counterparts.  This data highlights the new role of XBP1 as a modulator of immune cell function in ovarian cancer.

The primary aim of this project is to define the role of XBP1 as a potential biomarker that predicts response or resistance to treatment.

Cancer is the uncontrolled growth of cells. All human cells are under the control of many different influencing mechanisms. Cancer cells have escaped one or more of these mechanisms in a way that allows them to grow and evade cell death. One method used by some types of cancer cells to avoid cell death is the overexpression of proteins referred to as PD-L1 and PD-L2, which allow cancer cells to suppress your immune system. Pembrolizumab is a therapeutic antibody that works to reinvigorate your immune system by preventing the action of PD-L1 and PD-L2. This helps to allow your healthy immune cells target and destroy cancer cells. Pembrolizumab, also known as KEYTRUDA, is approved in USA and several other countries for the treatment of another type of cancer.

Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate (IDC-P) is a morphologic entity which is associated with high grade, high stage, and high volume of invasive carcinoma on radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens and poor prognosis in prostate cancer.  It is believed to represent retrograde spread of invasive high grade prostate cancer along prostatic ducts. However, there are few published studies on the molecular and immunohistochemical features of IDC-P, and most involve a relatively small number of cases.  

Purpose and Objective:
To characterize the molecular features of IDC-P in a larger cohort of cases than has previously been studied with the goal of gaining insight into its pathogenesis and identification of differences/similarities with the associated invasive carcinoma(s). Specifically, we wish to determine if any molecular feature(s) of IDC-P may explain its association with poor prognosis (e.g. higher frequency of PTEN loss, SPINK1 overexpression, or copy number alterations compared to matched controls).  A secondary aim of this study is to determine whether IDC-P is a precursor lesion to invasive high grade prostate cancer in a subset of cases.   

Methodology:  
A preliminary search of our surgical pathology database reveals approximately 200 RP specimens containing IDC-P from 2010-2015.  We plan to review these cases, quantify the total tumor volume and volume of IDC-P, and construct a TMA.  The TMA will include cores from areas of IDC-P, invasive carcinoma, high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN), and benign prostatic tissue, from each case (when available).  Immunohistochemical staining for HMWCK will be used on whole slides on select cases where it may be difficult to distinguish IDC-P from invasive carcinoma with cribriform morphology.  A control TMA (cases lacking IDC-P) will be constructed of a similar number of RPs, with statistical matching for age, stage, and grade.

Immunohistochemistry for ERG and SPINK1 overexpression will be performed, as well as FISH to assess frequency of PTEN loss.  Based on prior pilot studies, a study involving 140 cases in each cohort will allow us to detect a difference in PTEN loss in stratified analyses involving a maximum of 5 Gleason grade strata (with 90% power at an alpha level of 0.05).   ERG overexpression has been reported with a similar to higher rate in IDC-P than in conventional invasive disease, and the frequency of SPINK1 overexpression in IDC-P has never been reported.  

On a subset of cases, copy number alterations will be assessed in IDC-P versus invasive carcinoma and versus HGPIN using the Oncoscan FFPE Assay kit from Affymetrix core facilities.  Copy number alterations will be compared, and areas of copy number gain will be analyzed with selected loci validated by FISH testing on the TMA slides.",5,"fkhani1","Admin approved - BH 5/11/16",1,10-MAY-16,"Retrieval of slides and select blocks for 400 cases (approximately 200 IDC-P and 200 without IDC-P) x $5):  $2000

The calcification of coronary arteries has been shown to correlate with major adverse cardiac events. Coronary artery calcium scoring although not yet included in guidelines, is now commonly obtained and discussed with patients for decision-making before the use of statins. The calcification is pathologically localized to the atherosclerotic neointima. It has also now become customary to correlate calcification in various vascular beds with coronary calcification. Besides establishing diffuseness of the disease, calcification of any arterial territory offers prognostic information. Therefore, calcification is routinely reported in non-cardiac radiologic testing. Recently, the relationship of medial arterial calcification has also been reported with the coronary artery calcification. It has been proposed that the vascular calcification such as in breast arteries encountered during routine mammograms may offer up to 50 percent likelihood of similar extent of coronary artery calcification and hence high risk in women wherein the disease may otherwise not have been suspected. Prostate and uterine artery calcification have similar pathology and may shed light on the relevance of calcification process in the intima and media and therefore relationship with wider atherosclerotic process.

The standard of care has changed in the last decade to first perform a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and if positive for metastatic carcinoma, a subsequent axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is performed. Routine SLNB has dramatically reduced the number of ALND and its associated morbidities. 
Sentinel lymph node metastasis is sub-classified such that isolated tumor cells (ITC) are considered a deposit of carcinoma < 0.2mm or a cluster of tumor cells fewer than 200 cells in a single histological cross section.  A micro-metastasis is a deposit of carcinoma > 0.2mm. Macro-metastasis is defined as carcinoma measuring > 2mm. In the AJCC Cancer Staging Handbook, these categories are respectively staged as pNO (i+), pN1(mi), and pN1. 
Evaluation of sentinel lymph nodes by hematoxylin & eosin and immunohistochemical studies (e.g. CK AE1/AE3) has increased the sensitivity for detecting ITC and micro-metastasis.3, 5 A literature search yields few and limited studies investigating the surgical management and clinical outcome in patients with ITC.1,2,5,6  ITC is usually identified in patients with lobular carcinoma rather than ductal carcinoma. Current ASCO and NCCN guidelines recommend ALND with any size of metastases. However, an increasing number of surgeons do not perform ALND when ITC are found.4 
We identified 150 cases from our surgical pathology files (2010- 2016). Our goals are to describe lobular ITC and micro-metastasis, evaluate their histopathological characteristics and pattern of distribution, and provide follow-up on clinical management and outcomes.

The Programmed cell death (PD-1) axis in cancer immunotherapy has gained particular recognition for the durable responses associated with the use of PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors in a variety of advanced solid tumors and lymphomas1?10. PD-L1 expression on the membrane of tumor cells correlate with an enhanced response to PD-1 immunotherapy, namely in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)5 and Hodgkin?s Lymphoma (HL)8. Based on prognostic utility of PD-L1 expression in NSCLC, the immunohistochemical antibody PD-L1 IHC 28-8 Dako pharmDx ? P150025 (Carpinteria, CA) is now FDA approved. PD-L1 is expressed by various types of lymphoma cells and is absent in non-malignant lymphoid cells11 making it a promising biomarker and therapeutic target. In Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD), PD-L1 is expressed in up to 70% of EBV positive cases11?13. However, little is known regarding the prognostic role of PD-L1 or PD-L2 expression in these lesions. Since PD-1 Ligand expression is a mechanism by which tumor cells evade the immune system1,11,14?18, it is likely that standard therapy with reduction in immunosuppressive (RIS) would not benefit patients with PD-L1 and/or PD-L2 positive PTLD. The primary objective of this study is to correlate PD-1 Ligand expression in PTLD of SOT and SCT recipients with treatment outcomes pertaining to RIS, with or without Rituximab. We will carry out a retrospective review of PTLD cases at our institution that have tissue specimens available for immunohistochemical staining and will consider looking at mRNA expression PD-L1 and correlate with clinical response rates.",5,"mng2002","Admin approved - BH 6/17/16",1,15-JUN-16,"900$ for unstained IHC

We previously discovered over-expression and gene amplification of both AURKA (encodes the cell cycle regulating Aurora kinase A) and of MYCN (encodes the oncogenic transcription factor N-Myc) in NEPC as compared to prostate adenocarcinoma. MYCN is similarly amplified in a subgroup of neuroblastoma, a pediatric neuroendocrine tumor. In both prostate cancer and neuroblastoma, MYCN amplification is indicative of extremely poor prognosis. 

There is no clinically relevant mouse model of N-Myc driven NEPC. To address this the Rickman lab generated xenografts, a novel genetically engineered mouse (GEM) model of neuroendocrine prostate cancer that expresses N-Myc specifically in prostate epithelial cells and derived mouse prostate cancer organoids (Dardenne et al. Cancer Cell, 2016). Briefly, we generated GEM lines that carry a CAG-driven lox-stop-lox human MYCN gene integrated into the ROSA26 (LSL-MYCN) locus and a Tmprss2 (tamoxifen-induced (T2-Cre)) or probasin driven Cre recombinase (Pb-Cre). Since PTEN deletion is a frequent alteration in CRPC and NEPC (40-50%) and PI3K/AKT signaling can enhance N-Myc protein stability, we also engineered the mice to harbor a Pten conditional knockout allele.

To verify the NEPC histology and molecular similarity of this new mouse model a pathological evaluation needs to be performed using H/E slides and IHC of multiple prostate cancer biomarkers (e.g. andorgen receptor, EZH2, H3K27me3, synaptophysin, chromogranin, N-Myc, etc).

For this, xenografts, organoids and mouse prostates from mice with different genotypes and at different ages need to be analyzed processed using the WCM-Dept Pathology  TRP core facility and to be evaluated Dr. Brian Robinson.

Based on ~200 xenografts, organoids and mouse prostate samples we estimated that a total of 1,000 slides will be needed for this (stained for H/E and for the IHC biomarkers listed above.

In CD, Type 1 T-helper (TH1) and TH17 lymphocytes are believed to be selectively activated.  In contrast, TH2 cells are thought to play a role in UC.  Adding to this complexity is the recent finding that innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are also likely important cell mediators in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

These findings have triggered intense commercial interest in developing biological agents for IBD treatment.  The prototype of these agents is anti-TNF antibody, including infliximab , adalimumab and Cerolizumab.

Acute replenishment of adipsin in mouse models of DM2 improves glucose homeostasis by increasing glucose stimulated insulin secretion. Adipsin acts in the pancreas through its downstream molecule, C3a, and its interaction with the C3a receptor 1 (C3aR1). The goal of the present study is to 1) evaluate the effect of chronic adipsin treatment on pancreatic islet composition in a model of DM2 and 2) characterize the target cell for adipsin/C3a action in pancreatic islets (beta, alpha, delta or other cell types.

However, some early cancers can ulcerate, closely mimicking a benign lesion. Regenerative changes in benign, injured mucosa can mimic neoplasia, particularly when material is scant. On the other hand, cancers can show subtle abnormalities that are readily overlooked, making it difficult to recognize them in small samples.  Given that most gastric cancers develop on a background of mucosal atrophy and hypochlorhydria and incomplete sterilization of gastric contents, we hypothesize that examining the luminal contents (i.e. ulcer debris) in biopsies of ?gastric ulcers? may provide clues to the etiology. 

We plan to evaluate the nature of ulcer debris in gastric biopsy samples of 50 ulcerated cancers and 50 benign ulcers in order to determine whether any features, such as fungal or bacterial colonization, are useful clues to the presence of invasive carcinoma.

TNBC is a heterogenous group of tumors that is defined only by the lack of the estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2 protein overexpression. Within this group, there is a spectrum of histologic subtypes including medullary carcinoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma, which traditionally are associated with favorable prognoses, and invasive poorly differentiated ductal carcinomas, NOS, which are associated with unfavorable prognoses2,3. 

Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have emerged as a prognostic indicator of disease free and overall survival in TNBC4-6. TILs are defined as all mononuclear cells, including plasma cells, within the tumor bed. TILs are associated with younger age, higher histologic grade, ER negative tumors, basal-like cell type, TNBC and higher Ki67 proliferation index4,7. It has been suggested that immune profiling of TILs may prove to be a better predictor of disease free survival, overall survival and response to chemotherapy in TNBC than TIL counts alone8-11 . 

TILs are mostly composed of CD3+ cells with the majority co-expressing CD8+ and to a lesser extent CD4+. The amount of intratumoral or peritumoral CD8+ TILs has been an independent predictor of good response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and survival8,12,13. CD4+ has been shown to correlate with both good and poor prognoses 7,14-16. Few studies have assessed CD20+ TILs in breast cancer, but one study showed that CD20+ was significantly associated with breast cancer specific survival and longer disease interval survival17.  Despite all stromal lymphocytes and plasma cells being included in clinical TIL counts, as recommended by the 2014 Working Group19, there is very limited information about the significance, if any, of CD20+ and CD138+ cells in TILs of TNBC.

Studies show that both the presence tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and immune dysregulation can affect response to NAC.  Being able to better predict which tumors may achieve pathological complete response (pCR) or substantial decrease in residual cancer burden (RCB) following NAC may assist clinicians in guiding treatment strategies.  

Immune dysregulation by tumor cells is a key feature of breast cancer.  Immune checkpoint modulators which have received attention due to developments in targeted therapy include targeting programmed death 1 (PD-1), programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), programmed death ligand 2 (PD-L2), and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4).  PD-1 is expressed on T cells, B cells, and other immune effector cells.1  Expression of PD-1 in breast cancer has not yet been described, however has been demonstrated in other tumor types.2  PD-L1 is expressed on cancer cells3 and PD-L2 is expressed on cancer cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, mast cells and B cells.4  PD-1 interacts with PD-L1 and PD-L2 to downregulate the action of T cells.5,6  High PD-L1 has been shown to predict pCR in breast cancer patients treated with NAC.7  Little is known about the effect of PD-L2 expression on response to NAC.  CTLA-4 is a T-cell surface receptor with downregulates T-cell function and proliferation.8  CTLA-4 expression has also been documented in breast cancer cells;9 however its role in response to NAC has not been well studied.  Forkhead box P3 protein (FOXP3) is a transcription factor involved in regulating immune system development and acts as a transcriptional repressor of breast oncogenes.  FOXP3 is expressed in some breast cancers and has been demonstrated to have a prognostic effect in patients treated with NAC but has not been shown to predict response.10  

Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes recently emerged as a predictive and prognostic biomarker in patients with breast cancer.11-13  TILs are comprised predominately of CD8+ T lymphocytes, with B lymphocytes and monocytes being less common and less well defined14,15  and specific leukocyte subsets have been shown to either demonstrate tumor-suppressive or tumor-stimulating activity.16  In breast cancer, high TILs have been demonstrated to correlate with response to NAC17,18 and specific subsets of TILs have also been shown to predict response to NAC.18-20  While most studies concentrate on pre-NAC TILs, at least one demonstrated that increased concentration of TILs in residual tumor following NAC also predicts better prognosis.21  Increased density of PD-1+ TILs predicts unfavorable outcome in breast cancer,17 however data regarding effect on NAC response is limited.  Studies regarding expression patterns of CTLA-4 expression on TILs and response to NAC are lacking.  While increased FOXP3+ TIL density has been associated with improved response to NAC, increased FOXP3+ TILs have been associated with poor outcomes following NAC.11,17,18  FOXP3+ TILs have also been shown to decrease in patients with pCR compared to those with RCB following NAC.11,22

Preliminary data from clinical trials in metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) of the head and neck also showed encouraging results with 20-30% response rate, and FDA approval for anti-PD-1 antobodies (Nivolumab and Pembrolizumab) in this tumor type is highly anticipated within 2016.

Despite this exciting clinical progress, no biomarkers are available that would help predict the subset of patients that would respond to this costly therapy.  Several potential candidates, including tumor mutation loads, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), expression of PD-1 in TILs and other stromal inflammatory cells, and expression of PD-L1 in tumor cells, are areas of active investigation in various tumor types.  

The literature on PD-L1 expression in head and neck SqCC has been limited, and the results of these few studies are difficult to compare due to: 
1) Inclusion of cytoplasmic staining as positive in some studies, in contrast to only scoring the (biologically more meaningful) membranous staining; 
2) TMA was used in some studies when the stroma-tumor interface is where IFN-induced PD-L1 expression occurs and should be scored; 
3) Failure to include HPV status in the study design when HPV-induced tumors are significantly different from HPV-unrelated SqCC in their immunogenicity and likely in treatment response; 
4) Analysis of primary SqCC in most studies when metastatic SqCC likely will have different PD-L1 expression due to different microenvironment and the dynamic nature of PD-L1 expression; and 
5) Different anti-PD-L1 antibodies utilized.

To appropriately evaluate the expression of PD-L1 in metastatic SqCC in head and neck, we plan to perform PD-L1 staining using antibody SP142 (Spring Bioscience) and whole FFPE tissue sections.  The results will be quantitated using HALO image analysis.  PD-1 expression in TILs will also be evaluated.  The data and possible correlates that will be evaluated include:
1.	Frequency of PD-L1 expression, distinguishing innate PD-L1 expression in the center of tumor versus induced expression at the stroma-tumor interface

This alteration is also oncogenic and is an oncogenic driver in lung adenocarcinoma and lung sarcomatoid carcinoma. One proposed mechanism for this oncogenic effect is the loss of a key phosphorylation site needed for CBL ligase based protein degradation. Loss of exon 14 leads to protein persistence/resistance to degradation.

between tumors and the immune system can result in tumor suppression through activation of adaptive and innate immune mechanisms as a response to tumor antigens. The immuno-editing theory describes the process by which tumor cells escape immune regulation through the loss of tumor antigens, adaptation of defects in antigen processing and presentation, development of insensitivity to immune effector mechanisms or promotion of immunosuppressive conditions in the tumor microenvironment [Schreiber, Science, 2011]. We hypothesize that NEPC tumors have developed mechanisms to suppress immune activation.

Despite sharing some architectural similarities, during the last decade HP have been regarded as a separate entity from sessile serrated adenomas/polyps (SSA/P) which are now considered as neoplastic precursors similar to dysplastic polyps. Hyperplastic polyps are further subdivided into microvesicular, goblet-cell rich, and mucin-poor subtypes. Emerging pathologic and molecular evidence have questioned the non-neoplastic nature of the hyperplastic polyp, as these lesions commonly harbor BRAF V600E mutations, particularly within the microvesicular type, with up to 85% mutation rates in certain studies. KRAS mutations in exon 2 have also been identified in up to 36% of HP, particularly within the goblet-cell rich type.  These molecular changes and their morphologic similarities suggest that the HP might be a proliferative lesion that in some patients evolves into the larger polyp that we now call sessile serrated adenomas.   Not uncommonly, at the time of endoscopic examination polyps are identified that microscopically appears to be composed as relatively normal colonic mucosa.  However, critical microscopic analysis of the mucosa reveals differences in the architecture and number of cells of the crypts in the polypoid area compared to the non-polypoid mucosa.  We believe that these polyps represent the ?true? hyperplastic polyps of the colon.  The pathogenesis, molecular alterations, and potential progression of these lesions are unknown, and the histologic classification remains ill-defined. 
We plan to further investigate the clinicopathologic and molecular features of these endoscopically but not histologically apparent polyps by retrospectively reviewing 30 cases from 2015-2016.  We will then determine their BRAF and KRAS status through sequencing of exon 15 and exon 2, respectively. We postulate that the frequent BRAF mutations and less common KRAS mutations seen in the traditional hyperplastic polyp will not be identified in biopsies of ?true? hyperplastic polyps.

In the past individual case reports have documented that PTLDs can be multiclonal multifocal proliferations, in contrast to most non-Hodgkin lymphomas, which, based in immunoglobulin and T cell receptor rearrangement studies, are usually uniclonal multifocal processes.  However, this has not been documented in a large number of PTLD cases.  Furthermore, the molecular genetic composition of these lesions has not been fully characterized.  Although there are some papers in the literature addressing this, they too are limited in number and scope.  In addition, in the sequential lesions it is not clear if there is progressive acquisition of additional genetic alterations; specifically a systematic study of multiple biopsies from an individual patient has not been done. Thus, the goals of this study are:
(1)  Evaluate the clonality of the different PTLD lesions arising in an individual patient
(2)  Evaluate the molecular genetic composition of these lesions, including those from patients with multiple lesions occurring either simultaneously or sequentially
(3)  Correlate any pertinent genetic markers with appropriate immunostains (ie TP53 mutations with results of p53 immunostaining)
(4) If possible correlate with clinical course, outcome and EBV status (EBER, LMP1 and EBNA2).

The number of cases to be evaluated will depend on the number of patients and the number of samples per patient, however, it appears that we have reviewed approximately 15-20 patients with multiple samples in the Immunopathology laboratory, including some from outside institutions.  We wish to start with approximately 50 cases from these patients, as a pilot, after which we will evaluate the results.  If additional cases are needed we will reapply to the TRP.

The cases will be evaluated by PCR for clonality (IgH, IgK and as needed TCR) and then examined using the lymphoid panel being developed by Drs. Kluk and Tam.  Cases will also be punched for the generation of a TMA for immunophenotypic analysis and confirmation of any pertinent genetic findings.  Data will be correlated with clinical findings and outcome, which will be supplied by Dr. Sarah Rutherford from the Division of Hematology and Oncology.

The 26S proteasome is a large multi-protein complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins. The active 26S proteasome consists of the 20S core particle, which is responsible for the actual proteolysis, and the 19S regulatory complex.  Cancer cells endure internal proteotoxic stress due to high metabolic rates, lack of energy and aneuploidy. Despite this pressure, they successfully proliferate and efficiently withstand this stress. We hypothesize that cancer cells resistance to the proteotoxic stress drives from changes in the UPS, balancing protein overload.
Cancer cells endure internal proteotoxic stress due to high metabolic rates, lack of energy and aneuploidy. Using mouse model of colon cancer, we discovered a novel mechanism that counterbalances the protein overload in malignant cells. We demonstrated that under tumorigenic transformation of the gut epithelium, 26S proteasome assembly is significantly increased. Importantly, we found that increased 26S assembly is specifically seen in transformed cells, but not in other rapidly dividing cells. This is an energy dependent, tightly regulated multi-step process and therefore unlikely to result from random mutations typical of tumor cells. We propose that enhanced proteasomal assembly in tumors is a distinct mechanism that protects cancer cells against proteotoxic stress, and that this process can be selectively targeted for therapy.  Since all work was done on the mouse model we are looking to confirm the data on human samples prior to moving to the small molecule screen, targeting cancer associated 26S assembly.

Background:	  Even though >80% of men with prostate cancer (PCa) have multiple, genetically distinct cancer foci at resection, multiclonality is not incorporated into routinely reported pathological parameters, such as the number of biopsy cores with cancer. Despite efforts into the identification of biomarkers to distinguish indolent from aggressive disease, routine pathological parameters, serum PSA, and clinical findings are the main factors used to determine whether a man with prostate cancer on biopsy is a candidate for active surveillance vs. definitive treatment. 

Aims:	  The potential to refine pathologic parameters through assessing multiclonality represents a major opportunity. The objective of this proposal is to first assess the frequency of multiclonality in key clinical scenarios at biopsy and resection. We will determine the impact of multiclonality on the ability of pathological parameters at biopsy to predict pathology at resection or outcome after resection. We hypothesize that incorporating multiclonality will improve the predictive ability of pathological parameters, and in doing so, will increase the number of men eligible for active surveillance. No prior studies have assessed multiclonality frequency in key clinical scenarios and hence this study represents an entirely novel area of research. 

Methods:   We will assess for the presence of two common molecular PCa subtype-defining biomarkers using a dual ERG/SPINK1 IHC assay that we developed (Bhalla et al, Mod Pathol 2013). We will identify 100 cases (biopsy and corresponding prostatectomy) in key clinical scenarios, assess ERG/SPINK1, and determine the impact of incorporating multiclonality on the prognostic significance of routine histologic parameters. 
	
Clinical applicability:   Multiclonality has the potential to dramatically impact routine pathological parameters in PCa. Currently, the number of biopsy cores with cancer drives treatment decisions in up to 30% of newly diagnosed cases. Through assessing ERG/SPINK1 status, our preliminary data suggests that in up to 30% of cases, positive cores actually represent at least two smaller tumor foci (Fontugne et al, Mod Pathol 2016). We predict that these findings will be associated with smaller, less aggressive pathology on resection.  Confirmation of these findings and demonstration of their impact on prognostic parameters through the studies proposed herein will likely require reassessment of current pathological practice. Our study also has profound implications for prognostic tests performed on biopsy cores, whether single immunohistochemical markers or multi-gene assays (such as Prolaris or Oncotype DX), which presume that all positive cores represent a single tumor focus and ignore the multiclonality that can be present on biopsy.   

Impact:   Although multiclonality in prostate cancer has long been recognized, the limitations of routine pathological examination have forced pathologists to make assumptions that are challenged by our preliminary data and open an entirely new area of translational PCa research. Our proposal has the potential to dramatically increase the number of men eligible for active surveillance through refining parameters currently used to drive treatment decisions.",5,"Samaneh","Admin approved - BH 1/12/17",1,10-JAN-17,"",,2,"jmm9018@med.cornell.edu","Juan Miguel Mosquera, MD","JMM",0,"",,,,,,""

We previously discovered overexpression and gene amplification of both AURKA
(encodes the cell cycle regulating Aurora kinase A) and of MYCN (encodes the oncogenic transcription factor NMyc) in NEPC as compared to prostate
adenocarcinoma. MYCN is similarly amplified in a subgroup of neuroblastoma, a pediatric neuroendocrine tumor. In both prostate cancer and neuroblastoma, MYCN amplification is indicative of extremely poor
prognosis.

There is no clinically relevant mouse model of N-Myc driven NEPC. To address this the Rickman lab generated xenografts, a novel genetically engineered mouse (GEM) model of neuroendocrine prostate cancer that expresses N-Myc specifically in prostate epithelial cells and derived mouse prostate cancer organoids (Dardenne et al. Cancer Cell, 2016). Briefly, we
generated GEM lines that carry a CAG-driven lox-stoplox human MYCN gene integrated into the ROSA26 (LSL-MYCN) locus and a Tmprss2 (tamoxifen-induced (T2-Cre)) or probasin driven Cre recombinase (Pb-Cre).
Since PTEN deletion is a frequent alteration in CRPC and NEPC (40-50%) and PI3K/AKT signaling can enhance N-Myc protein stability, we also engineered the mice to harbor a Pten conditional knockout allele.

To verify the NEPC histology and molecular similarity of this new mouse model a pathological evaluation needs to be performed using H/E slides and IHC of multiple prostate cancer biomarkers (e.g. andorgen receptor,
EZH2, H3K27me3, synaptophysin, chromogranin, NMyc, Chromogranin A, NCAM1, Sox2, Krt8, CK5, pan-cytokeratin, vimentin).

For this, xenografts, organoids and mouse prostates from mice with different genotypes and at different ages need to be analyzed processed using the WCM-Dept Pathology TRP core facility and to be evaluated Dr.
Brian Robinson.

Based on ~20 xenografts, organoids and mouse prostate samples we estimated that a total of 100 slides will be needed for this (stained for H/E and for the IHC biomarkers listed above.

Majority of aHUS cases have been associated with inherited and/or acquired defects of the regulatory factors of the alternate complement pathway.1-2 This results in acute, chronic or relapsing uncontrolled activation of the complement system leading to TMA. In this context, the serum levels of complement activation C5a and C5b-9 (terminal complement or membrane attack complex) have been variably elevated as biomarkers.3-4 Since biomarker studies and testing have yet to be optimized and standardized, and not entirely resolved, search for tissue markers are being explored.3-4 Microvascular deposition of C5b-9 in this setting has shown some usefulness both in the skin and kidneys in patients with aHUS,3-5 particularly in view of emerging new therapies to target complement activation for effective treatment of this irreversible disease resulting in end-stage kidney disease requiring transplantation.6 A high incidence of recurrence of aHUS within the 1st year of renal transplantation with allograft loss has also been documented.7 We propose to study the staining patterns of C5b-9 in renal biopsies (in 60 cases native and transplant) showing evidence of TMA (acute, subacute and chronic) by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining of C5b-9. Appropriate controls will be used. Data from such a study may be used to implement an additional test in the work up of a case of TMA that may have an impact on the choice of therapy and further genetic testing of the complement system. Thus far, no guidelines for interpretation of immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence for C5b-9 exists. Clinical presentation, renal pathological findings (LM, IF, EM) and follow up information will be retrospectively reviewed and correlated with the C5b-9 results.

 that implicates, within the synovium, cross-talk between T and B lymphocytes, MO and FLS, which drives the initiation and perpetuation of synovial inflammation. The concept that FLS in RA are not innocent bystanders, but function as pathogenic cells, especially during the perpetuation phase and possibly in the initiation phase, is supported by several studies. FLS derived from pannus exibit a unique phenotype that shares morphologic features with tumor cells and thus RA FLS were described as ?transformed? cells.  RA FLS are resistant to apoptosis potentially due to somatic mutations in p53, triggered by the genotoxic inflammatory synovial microenvironment. RA FLS, but not OA FLS, display and retain an invasive and destructive capacity against articular cartilage. FLS express adhesion molecules and receptors for cytokines, chemokines, and TLR ligands that mediate their activation during synovial inflammation. Upon activation, FLS produce a constellation of cytokines, growth factors, chemokines, adhesion molecules, co-stimulatory molecules and tissue destructive factors. As a result of this mutifaceted activation, FLS mediate synovial recruitment, retention, organization, activation and survival of inflammatory cells, enhance synovial neoangiogenesis, and induce osteoclastogenesis and cartilage degradation.
In our recent report, we have shown that TNF &#945; induces in RA FLS a sustained and unremitting inflammatory response, characterized by sustained production of inflammatory response, characterized by sustained production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. We have found that TNF &#945; induced prolonged activation of the classical NF-&#954;&#914; pathway and sustained histone acetylation, chromatin accessibility, p65 and RNA polymerase II occupancy at the promoter region of IL6. In addition, we observed that, in contrast to macrophages, where the inflammatory response to TNF &#945; is effectively terminated, RA FLS express lower levels of the signaling inhibitors ABIN3, SOCS3, and IRAK-M, and of the transcriptional repressors ATF3, Hes-1 and Hey-1. These observations support the concept that in RA FLS there are insufficient ?brakes? to turn off the inflammatory response to TNF- &#945;.  In this study, we aim to investigate the molecular mechanisms leading to the shaping of a pathogenic chromatin landscape in FLS by TNF-&#945; and investigates whether TNF &#945; -induced chromatin modifications in FLS are permanent or reversible in discarded tissue obtained from surgery of RA patients.

We used next generation sequencing (NGS) to compare the molecular signatures in multiple lung adenocarcinomas.

Design: The study group included 13 patients (29 lung adenocarcinomas). Tumors were diagnosed in resection specimens (n=26) or by fine needle aspiration (n=3). All tumors were subjected to ALK rearrangement testing (FISH) and targeted NGS (50 gene cancer panel) as requested by the treating clinician.

Results: The cohort consisted of 9 females and 4 males. The synchronous lung tumors were located in the same lobe (n=6 patients), different lobes of the same lung (n=3) or contralateral lung (n=4). The adenocarcinomas were non-mucinous and resected tumors were classified as invasive (n=22), minimally invasive (n=3) and in-situ (n=1). Morphological comparison was performed in resection specimens from 11 patients. 

Tumors located in the same lobe were grossly and radiographically separate and histologically distinct in all 6 patients. Different genomic variants were identified in 2 of the 6 patients. In contrast, all 7 tumors in contralateral lungs or different lobes of the same lung harbored different mutations. Overall, 9 of the 13 patients (69%) with synchronous tumors had different and potentially actionable molecular alterations in EGFR, KRAS and PI3KCA genes as well as alterations in TP53, STK11 and PTEN. None of the specimens harbored ALK fusions.

Conclusion: Genomic profiles of synchronous lung adenocarcinomas complement the histological findings, improving accurate staging and identifying genetic alterations with therapeutic implications.

ASCO/CAP guidelines state that the tumor should be classified as ER or PR positive if at least 1% of cells show positive staining for these markers. For assessing receptor status in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), various scoring systems such as the Allred score and histochemical ?H? score are used. A simple percentage of cells staining and staining intensity are also commonly reported.  However, there is no standardized scoring system for reporting hormone receptor expression. Further, there is no established cutoff value for what is considered positive.  Adjuvant endocrine therapy in patients with ER-positive DCIS has been shown to be beneficial in reducing local recurrence in one large study in which the Allred Score was performed. 
	Because there is no standardized method of reporting ER expression in DCIS, there is a concern that patients with weakly ER-positive DCIS may be misclassified as ER-negative, depending on the scoring system used, which would deny them the benefit of endocrine therapy. Weakly ER-positive tumors are seen infrequently in invasive breast carcinoma, and most show a bimodal distribution, i.e. strongly positive or completely negative. 
	The goal of our study is to examine the distribution of ER/PR staining in DCIS. We hypothesize that as is seen in invasive breast carcinoma, DCIS will also show a bimodal distribution for ER expression. We expect more variability to be seen with PR. We would like to compare how cases of DCIS are classified, depending on the scoring method used ? Allred, H score, and %/intensity.  We have collected slides from 500 DCIS cases with corresponding ER and PR stains. All slides are currently being reviewed and H scores and Allred scores will be generated by us. 
We are requesting support from biostatistics for additional statistics we would like to perform. Specifically, we would like to show the frequency distribution of both ER and PR in DCIS per nuclear grade, H score, and Allred score. Additionally, we would like to correlate the levels of ER and PR expression with specific clinicopathologic variables such as age, presentation, growth pattern of DCIS, nuclear grade of DCIS, and the presence of necrosis.

We identified a maximum tolerated dose, and all subjects underwent complete resection of residual tumor.  DNA methylation at control and biomarker regions was measured by digital droplet, bisulfite qPCR in tumor samples collected prior to therapy and at resection.  Hypomethylation of biomarker genes was observed at all dose levels and corresponded with surgical response.  
Demonstrating that hypomethylation by 5-azacitidine at the genetic loci observed in this study lead to reactivation of protein expression would support our hypothesis that tumor DNA hypomethylation may be a biomarker of epigenetic response.  With the help of the Translational Research Program, we would like to compare pre- and post-treatment tumor specimens using immunohistochemistry by staining for proteins corresponding to relevant genetic loci (particularly HPP1, but also CDKN2A, TIMP3, ESR1, MGMT1 if feasible) in the 12 patients enrolled on the study.  This will involve obtaining specimens which may be archived at outside institutions, obtaining and testing immunohistochemical stains for relevant proteins, cutting and staining tissue samples, as well as determination of adequacy and interpretation of immunohistochemical staining by a pathologist.",12,"kak9084","",1,28-SEP-15,"Request	Cost per service	# per block	# blocks (or 1 for flat)	Total Cost per service

Immune dysregulation by tumor cells is a key feature of breast cancer and recent progress in breast cancer therapy includes the development of therapies which target immune checkpoint blockade.  These include monoclonal antibodies targeting programmed death 1 (PD-1), programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), programmed death ligand 2 (PD-L2), and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4).  
Additionally, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) recently emerged as a predictive and prognostic biomarker in breast cancer, particularly TNBC.19-23 TILs are mainly comprised of CD3+/CD56- T cells, with a minority being natural killer cells or CD20+ cells.24  Studies have shown that density of PD-1+ and CTLA-4+ TILs correlates with survival.13, 25  Evaluation of TILs density and expression of PD-1 and CTLA-4 in TILs in conjunction with the expression of these and other aforementioned ligands may offer more insight into immune dysregulation in TNBC.

AMENDMENT:
For optimal immunohistochemical evaluation of PD-1 (programmed death 1) in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in our cohort of triple negative breast cancers, we propose using whole tissue sections from a representative tumor block of each case as we have found that previously constructed tissue microarrays of these cases contain cores of tumor and not TILs.  PD-1 stained slides will then be scanned using Aperio and interpreted using HALO software.

The anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb), rituximab, has dramatically improved the prognosis for patients with NHL, and has been a mainstay of treatment since its first approval in 1997. While rituximab has single-agent activity in both indolent and aggressive NHL, and more modest activity in CLL, the standard of care is to use it in combination with chemotherapy. Response rates to conventional therapy are generally greater than 50%, but most patients will relapse. In the relapsed or salvage setting, there are no standard of care options and the choice of therapy is often guided by patient clinical factors, including performance status and presence of comorbidities. Additionally, there is a growing body of data demonstrating the development of diminished activity of rituximab and rituximab resistance over time in multiple NHL subtypes.
REGN1979 is a bispecific (anti-CD20 and anti-CD3) monoclonal antibody, designed with a novel mechanism of action that is distinct from that of other anti-CD20 antibodies, and as such may provide a therapeutic benefit in patients who have relapsed following anti-CD20 mAb therapy. This first in human phase 1 study is designed to investigate the safety and tolerability of REGN1979.
Subjects will be assigned to a dose level cohort that will consist of an initial starting dose, followed by a higher dose for all subsequent administrations. REGN1979 will be administered as an IV infusion, weekly for the first four weeks, then monthly for five months, for a total of nine doses over six months. After completing the treatment period, subjects will have follow-up visits monthly for six months.

When it occurs in a patient with medical illness, it may be related to medication.  When the cause is not clear, the differential includes T cell large granular lymphocytic leukaemia (T-LGL), a neoplasm associated with suppression of PB neutrophil numbers.  Unlike most other lymphoid neoplasms, for which diagnostic criteria and supportive ancillary testing provide a clear diagnosis, the application of immunophenotyping and genetic studies to the diagnosis of T-LGL is less clear.

Because reactive T cell subsets fluctuate and vary, T-LGL is a neoplasm defined by a >6 month persistent increase in the number of peripheral blood (PB) large granular T lymphocytes without an identified cause. As this definition implies, an increase in CD8+ T cells is nonspecific.  Moreover, because a diminished CD4:CD8 means a relative increase in CD8 T cells,  a drop in CD4 cells can be misinterpreted as suspicious for T-LGL.  This is compounded by the fact that T cell subset normal values are computed only for PB, and those values often are mistakenly applied to other sites, like marrow.  

T-LGL is associated with autoimmune disorders.  Some data supports that it develops in the background of an inflammatory response.  This suggests a spectrum from autoimmune inflammation to an overt T-LGL and that where a patient falls on that spectrum will affect the difficulty of making a concrete diagnosis.

Polyps with dysplasia or abnormal &#946;-catenin expression were assessed for APC and CTNNB1 mutations.  Large hyperplastic polyps and adenomas were analyzed for KRAS and BRAF mutations.  
Complete loss of MGMT expression was significantly more frequent in large hyperplastic polyps (47%), often in combination with loss of p27 (47%), compared to adenomas (0% and 0%, p=0.02, respectively) and smaller lesions [0% (p=0.02) and 10% (p=0.09), respectively]. KRAS or BRAF mutations were detected in 20% of large hyperplastic polyps and 11% of adenomas.   
Small gastric hyperplastic polyps are likely non-neoplastic, reparative lesions, but large polyps often show immunohistochemical and molecular abnormalities such as concomitant loss of MGMT with p27 staining, APC or CTNNB1 mutations in areas of dysplasia, and KRAS or BRAF mutations. These findings raise the possibility that some large hyperplastic polyps of the gastric mucosa represent early neoplasms.

Graft-versus-host disease is a complex and serious complication of hematopoietic cell transplantation that occurs in 10-50% of transplant recipients. Gastrointestinal GVHD is a significant cause of morbidity in these patients, and even mild (grade 1) GVHD has been shown to correlated with mortality risk. Our clinical colleagues often have a high index of suspicion for GVHD in these at-risk patients, meaning that patients undergo endoscopic surveillance with tissue sampling soon after gastrointestinal symptoms begin. Early tissue sampling can result in mild histologic changes throughout the gastrointestinal tract and an inability of the pathologist to make a definitive diagnosis of mild GVHD vs. other. We plan to classify the histologic changes in these biopsy samples and to correlate with clinical presentation, laboratory data (including results of infectious work-up), clinical diagnosis/course of treatment, and patient outcome.  We aim to find histologic features that allow for increased sensitivity and specificity in a pathologic diagnosis of early/mild GVHD.

Approximately 75% of all invasive breast carcinomas are ER (+) (1). Typically, patients who are ER (+) are treated with endocrine based therapies and those that are ER (-) are treated with conventional forms of chemotherapy. The current ASCO/CAP guidelines recommend that ER (and PR) should be considered positive if 1% or more of tumor cells demonstrate (+) nuclear staining (2). This recommendation is based on the premise that patients may derive benefit from endocrine therapy even with minimal ER and PR reactivity (1,2). However, the benefit of treating weak ER (+) tumors with antihormonal therapies has been questioned (3,4). In addition, most weak ER (+) tumors have been shown to be of the non-luminal (ER (-)) molecular intrinsic subtype (5,6).
In clinical practice, ER (and PR) status is determined by performing immunohisto- chemistry (IHC) on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue. Most tumors that are ER (+) show strong, diffuse, nuclear staining by IHC. Approximately 15% of invasive breast carcinomas, however, demonstrate heterogeneous ER (+) with weaker intensity (1). In addition, up to 20% of IHC testing may show false (-) or false (+) results due to variation in pre, intra, and post analytic variables (2). As such, IHC technique and selection of the most reliable antibody is of paramount importance. The ASCO-CAP guidelines have recommended a list of ER antibodies that have established specificity and sensitivity, have been clinically validated, and have demonstrated good correlation with patient outcomes, including 6F11 and SP1 clones, which are currently validated for use in our laboratory (2).
The ER 6F11 antibody clone is routinely used in our laboratory, however, there has been difficulty with the interpretation of its staining patterns (7,8). In particular, a pattern of weak granular/punctate nuclear staining has been identified as a possible cause of false (+) ER results (8). At our institution, repeating IHC using a different clone (SP1) has yielded (-) results in some cases, and (+) in others.

Differentiated vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (dVIN) is a difficult histologic diagnosis due to its subtle morphology. In our practice, we encounter two main challenges regarding this entity: diagnosis of early dVIN in lichen sclerosus and distinction between dVIN and reactive epithelial atypia. Though p53 immunohistochemistry has been found to be a useful marker for the diagnosis of dVIN, it is not without limitations. Recently, GATA-3 and CK17 have shown promising results in the diagnosis of dVIN. We aim to study the immunohistochemical expression patterns of GATA-3, p53 and CK17 in dVIN, early dVIN and reactive epithelial atypia.

Although most lesions confined to the appendix behave in a benign fashion, a subset of morphologically low-grade lesions disseminate to the peritoneal cavity. The WHO classifies mucinous appendiceal tumors as low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasms (LAMN) when they show any of the following: loss of the lamina propria and muscularis mucosae, fibrosis of the submucosa, a ?pushing? pattern of growth into the wall, dissection of acellular mucin into the wall, or mucin and/or neoplastic mucinous epithelium out the wall of the appendix. Recently, the international peritoneal surface oncology group (PSOGI) proposed that mucinous adenoma and mucinous cystadenoma be eliminated from the vernacular, and that all low-grade mucinous tumors of the appendix be classified as LAMN.  We believe that this approach oversimplifies classification of mucinous appendiceal lesions and probably leads to overdiagnosis of LAMN among non-neoplastic conditions such as mucosal hyperplasia and diverticulosis. We plan to investigate histologic features of low-grade mucinous lesions of the appendix in order to better develop criteria to distinguish between neoplasms (i.e. adenoma and LAMN) and non-neoplastic mimics. We will evaluate all mucinous lesions diagnosed at our institution over a 10-year period and will correlate histologic features with patient outcome data available in the electronic medical record. A subset of cases deemed non-neoplastic will be subjected to KRAS mutational testing; KRAS mutations are frequently detected among LAMN, but their presence in non-neoplastic lesions has not been assessed. It is possible that KRAS status could represent a useful diagnostic tool.

While first characterized in 1986 as benign,(1) subsequent associations with higher-grade lesions such as atypical hyperplasia and carcinoma were discovered.(2) The widespread use of screening mammography has led to increased detection of asymptomatic MLLs due to their association with calcifications.(3) The management of MLL is somewhat controversial, with some studies proposing surgical excision and others suggesting only close follow-up. Recent translational studies show relatively low rates of upgrade from core biopsy to excision.(4-10) Due to the low incidence of MLL, relatively little published data is currently available and the optimal management of MLL is unclear.

The purpose of this study is to characterize a cohort of MLL at our institution and identify pathological, radiographic, and clinical features associated with MLL that may predict rate of upgrade and subsequent development of carcinoma.

Aims:

1.	Characterize histologic lesions associated with MLL (i.e. hyperplasia, atypia, carcinoma, columnar lesions, etc.).
2.	Characterize the quality/quantity of calcifications associated with MLL and correlate with risk of upgrade
3.	Determine upgrade rate and presence of residual MLL in cases of MLL identified on core biopsy with subsequent excision.
4.	Characterize radiologic findings in cases of MLL and correlate with risk of upgrade.
5.	Determine subsequent latency and frequency of cancer development in patients with MLL on biopsy.

Despite this change, the recognition of the two subtypes of LCIS: florid and pleomorphic (F-LCIS, P-LCIS), remains important as these variants have been established to be more often associated with invasive carcinoma and behave in an aggressive manner. Multiple studies have profiled classic LCIS (C-LCIS), F-LCIS and P-LCIS by immunohistochemistry and molecular studies. Estrogen receptor (ER) positivity is typically inversely related to the degree of proliferation, necrosis and pleomorphism in these variants. Thus, F-LCIS and P-LCIS are typically treated similarly to higher grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).

In recent years, the apocrine P-LCIS (AP-LCIS) has been recognized, but has not yet been fully characterized. Biomarker (including ER, PR and HER2) status of AP-LCIS is reportedly inconsistent; however, androgen receptor (AR) positivity is considered to be a typical finding. Previously conducted molecular studies (primarily using array-based comparative genomic hybridization platform) have identified F-LCIS and P-LCIS to harbor a 1q gain and 16q loss, supporting a C-LCIS lineage. Shin et al. showed a greater degree of genomic instability (chromosome gains, losses and amplifications) in F-LCIS in comparison to P-LCIS; however, AP-LCIS (in 6 cases) was found to be the most complex. Clearly, more morphological, immunohistochemical and molecular studies are needed to fully characterize AP-LCIS. 

	We plan to evaluate 225 P-LCIS cases, with or without synchronous invasive carcinoma. Of these cases, we expect to identify at least 25 cases of AP-LCIS. For each case, the clinical and histopathological features will be tabulated. ER, PR, HER2, Ki67 and AR will be assessed via immunohistochemistry (if not clinically tested already). An E-cadherin and/or p120 immunostain will be performed to confirm the diagnosis (if not clinically tested already). We also intend to obtain to-date clinical followup.

	Selected cases of AP-LCIS (with adequate diagnostic material) will also be submitted for Oncomine Comprehensive Mutation Panel assay testing. Microdissection of key sites will be performed to include only the in situ component. To our knowledge, thus far, this platform has not been utilized to evaluate LCIS and its variants. 

	Our study is intended to further characterize AP-LCIS on the basis of histopathological, immunohistochemical, molecular and clinical features.

The clinical significance of localized amyloidosis (?mammary amyloid tumor?) remains to be determined since the majority of the published cases have been case reports or small case series. Results of these studies show a wide array of contributing diseases (i.e. multiple myeloma and limited scleroderma), iatrogenic causes (i.e. exogenous insulin injection), and idiopathic causes.

In 2013, the largest series to date, comprising of 40 patients with breast amyloidosis at Mayo Clinic and MSKCC (Said SM, Reynolds C, Jimenez RE, Chen B, Vrana JA, Theis JD, Dogan A, Shah SS. Amyloidosis of the breast: predominantly AL type and over half have concurrent breast hematologic disorders. Mod Pathol. 2013 Feb;26(2):232-8). These authors determined that the most common amyloid type was AL, predominantly of the kappa type. Recommendation for further clinical work up was considered necessary since nearly half of their patients had systemic AL amyloidosis and had concurrent hematologic disorders.

We have identified five (5) cases of breast amyloidosis (i.e. mammary amyloid tumor) from 2000 to present in our Departmental material. Each case will be reviewed for pertinent clinical and pathological data after confirmation of diagnosis.The latter will be obtained via H&E and Congo Red special stain (most, if not all, will have a Congo Red special stain already performed for clinical diagnosis). To address any further underlying hematological diseases, additional immunohistochemical stains will be required including CD3, CD20, CD138, and kappa/lambda in situ hybridization. Pertinent paraffin-embedded blocks will subsequently be sent to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) to be processed, analyzed, and interpreted for mass spectrometry at no additional cost (as mutually agreed upon with Dr. Dogan of MSKCC). 

Our aim is to further characterize the entity of mammary amyloidosis (mammary amyloid tumor)?and help establish its clinical features, histopathological characteristics, natural history, immunohistochemical and mass spec profile. We hope that our study will help in the clinical management of these cases.

Malignant effusions can be the first manifestation of an occult malignancy. Lung carcinoma is the most common occult primary in patients presenting with a malignant effusion (1). Other causes include gastrointestinal, pancreas in men and ovarian in women. Lymphoma, melanoma and mesothelioma can also manifest in this manner. Of all causes of malignant effusions, however, distinguishing metastatic carcinoma from reactive mesothelium based on morphology alone, has been a persistent diagnostic challenge in cytopathology.  In the last decade, a variety of epithelial and mesothelial immunohistochemistry (IHC) markers have been reported in the literature such as CA19-9, Ber-EP4, MOC-31, B72.3 (2-4). It remains unclear whether a single immunostain can be the end all to this diagnostic dilemma.

Claudins are a family of transmembrane proteins consisting of more than 20 members and are a major functional constituent of tight junctions. These proteins are present at epithelial and endothelial cell interfaces and are responsible for multiple functions e.g. ion flux, recruitment of signaling proteins and regulating cell proliferation and differentiation (5) The disruption of tight junctions in tumorigenesis is well documented (6). Claudin-4, most specifically, is generally overexpressed during neoplastic transformation, can identify epithelial neoplasms and consistently shows negative staining in normal and neoplastic mesothelium (5-6). Compared to the classical markers Ber-EP4 and MOC-31, it also superiorly demonstrates a distinction between epithelial carcinomas and mesotheliomas. (5, 7-9). We would like to perform IHC staining for Claudin-4 on 30 pleural effusion cellblock preparations positive for metastatic lung adenocarcinoma, 10 benign pleural effusions and 10 pleural effusions positive for mesothelioma. 

Telomerase activation is a vital component of tumor self-renewal and development. The expression of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene is upregulated in the majority of human cancers and absent in most normal somatic tissues (10). hTERT upregulation in tumors has been found to occur through a variety of mechanisms including hTERT amplifications, hTERT structural variants, promoters and epigenetic modifications through hTERT promoter methylation (10). The regulation of hTERT through promoter mutations (TERTpMut) has been shown to be useful as a clinical biomarker with prognostic potential such as in urothelial carcinomas and gliomas (10-12). TERTpMut are a moderately prevalent genetic event in non-small cell lung carcinomas (10,13). The prevalence and association of TERTpMut in NSCLC have been studied with varying results, ranging from 0-5.8% (13-15). To our knowledge TERTpMut have not been exclusively studied in metastatic lung adenocarcinomas. We would like to perform IHC staining for TERT (Sienna Cancer Diagnostics Ltd.,Melbourne, Australia)  on 30 pleural effusion cellblock preparations positive for metastatic lung adenocarcinoma and 30 FNA samples positive for lung adenocarcinomas (in patients with well -differentiated adenocarcinoma on excision).",5,"patelami2010","Admin approved - BH 7/12/18",1,08-JUL-18,"Budget:

Identifying potential therapeutic targets is important in the treatment of TNBC and evaluating protein expression of such targets may better predict likelihood of response.  

Immune dysregulation by tumor cells is a key feature of breast cancer and recent progress in breast cancer therapy includes the development of therapies which target immune checkpoint blockade.  These include monoclonal antibodies targeting programmed death 1 (PD-1), programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4).  

Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) recently emerged as a predictive and prognostic biomarker in breast cancer, particularly TNBC.1-5 TILs are mainly comprised of CD3+/CD56- T cells, with a minority being natural killer cells or CD20+ cells.6  PD-1 is expressed on T cells, B cells, and other immune effector cells7 and interacts with the PD-L1 which expressed on a wide variety of tumors8-13 to downregulate the action of T cells. CTLA-4 is a T-cell surface receptor with downregulates T-cell function and proliferation.14  Studies have shown that density of PD-1+ and CTLA-4+ TILs correlates with survival.15, 16  Evaluation of TILs density and expression of PD-1 and CTLA-4 in TILs in conjunction with the expression of these and other aforementioned ligands may offer more insight into immune dysregulation in TNBC.

PD-L1 and CTLA-4 protein expression has been documented in breast cancer and different expression patterns of these proteins have been correlated with hormone receptor status, routinely assessed prognostic features and survival.8, 10, 15, 17-19  Anti-PD1 therapy has been shown to improve objective response rate and progression free survival in PD-L1 positive melanomas20, 21 and anti-PD1 therapy has shown some efficacy in PD-L1 positive, recurrent or metastatic TNBC.22  Anti-CTLA-4 therapy has been studied in patients with metastatic melanoma with objective clinical regression,23 and could potentially be used in the treatment of TNBC.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the density of PD-1+ and CTLA+ TILs using HALOTM imaging analysis software (Indica Labs, Corrales, NM) in a cohort of TNBC cases and correlate with histopathologic features and survival. Furthermore, we will evaluate PD-L1 expression in TNBC tumor cells using HALOTM imaging analysis software and correlate with histopathologic features and survival.

This high rate of interval CRCs implies that the progression of neoplasia in IBD CRC is distinct from sporadic CRC in which the percentage of interval carcinomas is 7%.  There is therefore a need for further study into the progression of neoplasia in IBD.  
There are very few studies on the molecular pathology of IBD CRC.  In older studies using single gene assays, TP53 mutations were found in non-dysplastic mucosa of UC patients.  Recent NGS studies only analyzed the carcinoma (and also found TP53 mutations) but did not sequence the background dysplasia or colitis.  While these studies all implicate prolonged inflammation as a model for progression of IBD neoplasia, the sequence of mutations as lesions progress from inflamed to carcinoma is unclear.   There are no published studies using NGS to analyze the non-neoplastic and neoplastic tissue in the same IBD patient.  We propose using NGS to sequence the normal, inflamed, dysplastic and carcinomatous tissue in 5 colonic resections of IBD CRC.

Further characterization of tumor cells using Cam5.2 IHC is also used to sub-classify tumors into densely and sparsely granulated phenotypes which has clinical relevance in patients with somatotrophic tumors as it predicts response to somatostatin analogs.  However, aside from some correlation between the clinical behavior of pituitary adenomas and Ki67 labeling indices, histopathological analysis of pituitary adenomas traditionally does a poor job of predicting outcome, including chance of recurrence, local aggression, and metastatic potential.  As the developmental biology of the anterior pituitary gland becomes better understood, the lineage-specificity of transcription factors is being considered as diagnostically relevant. However, this type of analysis is not widely used and there is little published data correlating the immunohistochemical status of pituitary transcription factors with clinical parameters including outcomes. Moreover, in so-called ?null cell adenomas? or those that (classically) did not immunohistochemically demonstrate evidence of hormone expression the relationship between cell lineage and outcomes could not be assessed.  In this study we will leverage a large volume of archival pituitary tumors given an active endoscopic neurosurgical practice at Weill Cornell Medicine to generate tissue microarrays and assess the relationship between transcription factor expression with a variety of clinical parameters including time to recurrence and local aggression.  We will also correlate the TF status to hormone expression status using the same TMAs. If possible, we would also explore correlating TF status with RNAseq expression data in a subset of 10-20 cases for which we also have frozen tissue, either through a collaboration with the Institute for Precision Medicine, or using an outside vendor.

PD-L1 is often overexpressed in several neoplasms, and tumor cells often block the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway to evade from being targeted by tumor-specific T cells.  Therefore, the blockade of immune checkpoints activated by the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is a promising strategy for targeting various types of cancers.  Recently, inhibition of the PD-L1 pathway by the FDA approved molecules Atezolizumab, Pembrolizumab, and Durvalumab demonstrated significant clinical activity in urothelial carcinoma patients.  There have also been several phase I and II studies that have shown dose-dependent ranges of PD-L1 expression, and this translates into different clinical response rates.  However, little is known about the expression of lymph nodes metastases and the temporal change in expression from the primary bladder tumor.

Purpose and Objective:
We aim to examine the fidelity between PD-L1 expression in primary urothelial cancer in the bladder and lymph node metastases, as well as the longitudinal change in expression prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy to post-surgery.  Interobserver variability will also be measured to assess for reproducibility.

Methodology:
As a multi-institutional study with the University of Pennsylvania, patients with a history of urothelial carcinoma who underwent cystectomy or partial cystectomy with positive lymph node metastases will be included in the study.   A preliminary search of Cornell?s patient databases reveals approximately 90 potential cases from our institution to contribute to this study.  The pathology cases from Cornell will be retrieved and unstained slides from representative sections of the primary bladder tumor and lymph node metastases will be sent to the University of Pennsylvania for PD-L1 staining.   GU pathologists at Penn and Cornell will independently score the staining of these specimens, in addition to the 30 cases that have already been obtained from the pathology department at Penn.

Potential causative factors include the chronic inflammatory state of the diseased mucosa as well as immunosuppressive therapies, including corticosteroids. In fact, studies have shown that CMV infection is far more frequent in immunocompromised patients with severe refractory colitis and is rarely identified in corticosteroid-naïve patients. Recently, biologic therapies that target immune pathways have been shown to be as an effective therapeutic approach and have become the first-line treatment for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. These agents target excessive proinflammatory cytokines and are thought to reduce the inflammatory response within the bowel mucosa. Early randomized clinical trials have examined the risk of infectious complications with these agents and suggest that there is no overall increased risk of infections after treatment. Given that patients are much less likely to receive corticosteroids in the biologic agent era (2010-2017), we hypothesize that the identification of CMV in ulcerated, active colitis biopsies has decreased compared to biopsies from 2002-2010.

We plan to evaluate the frequency of CMV identification in colonic biopsies with ulcerated chronic active colitis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. In total, 100 biopsies from 2002-2010 in patients treated with corticosteroids and 100 biopsies from 2010-2017 in corticosteroid-naïve patients will be included in the study.

In response, an International TILs Working Group (ITWG) set forth guidelines for TIL quantification by manual estimation of percent area occupied by stromal TILs within a single H&E stained section.10 However, in practice, manual estimation of TILs is onerous with poor inter-observer concordance.11 The ITWG guidelines state that TILs should be recorded as a continuous variable in 5% increments. However, due to the lack of reproducibility in stromal TIL density counts, some advocate that TIL quantification be split into lymphocytic predominant breast cancer (LPBC) and non-LPBC subgroups or in to three categories (<10%, 10-50% and >50%).6, 11The immune response to carcinoma is more complicated than binary or ternary classification systems. Additionally, a study designed to assess the reproducibility of the International TILs Working Group 2014 guidelines, found that reproducibility of this methodology amongst pathologists without the assistance of digital training systems lacked ideal concordance.12 With new technologies, including digital image analysis, evaluation of TILs, as a continuous parameter, with excellent intra- and inter-observer concordance, may be feasible. 
In our experience, the performance of digital image analysis is improved by using immunohistochemistry to highlight TILs. CD8+ TILs have been consistently shown to be associated with improved prognosis in hormone receptor negative and TNBC.7, 13-19 Moreover, we recently verified this finding.20 
 In recent work, we have shown that hotspot estimation using digital image analysis was better at predicting clinical outcomes than assessing the whole tumor.20 However, we have yet to evaluate concordance of multiple hotspots within a representative whole tissue section by a single observer. Additionally, concordance of a single hotspot among multiple pathologists has not been attempted. A study demonstrating superior intra- and inter-observer concordance using digital image analysis, immunohistochemistry and hotspots may inspire new guidelines to permit our methodology as a viable alternative. Our study will be modeled after recent work using interclass correlation coefficients and box and whisker plots to demonstrate our findings.11, 21 
	Using representative whole tissue sections from 50 cases of TNBC, we will evaluate the concordance of CD8+ TIL analysis using HALO software in three separate 2.2 mm diameter hotspots by a single pathologist and evaluate the concordance of CD8+ TIL analysis of a single 2.2 mm diameter hotspot among five pathologists. Additionally, we will evaluate the concordance of H&E TIL stromal density analysis following ITWG guidelines among five pathologists.

PD-L1 immunopositivity is currently defined by a combined positive score at least 1%. Unfortunately, there is not a great correlation between PD-L1 staining and response to therapy, particularly when only low-level staining is present; the data suggest overall response rates of up to 12% among all chemorefractory patients, regardless of PD-L1 immunostaining. Mismatch repair-deficient gastric cancers also show higher response rates to pembrolizumab than mismatch repair proficient tumors, regardless of extent of PD-L1 staining. Thus, PD-L1 testing alone is probably inadequate to identify patients who stand to benefit from immunotherapy. 
We have previously shown that gastric carcinomas with lymphoid stroma, which are enriched in EBV-positive tumors, show increased expression of PD-L1 comparable to morphologically similar mismatch repair deficient tumors. It is estimated that 10-15% of gastric cancers are EBV-related, although evaluation for EBV-encoded RNAs is not routinely performed on gastric cancers. We hypothesize that EBV-associated gastric cancers are under recognized, and EBV positivity may have important implications for response to immunotherapy. We plan to review our gastric and gastroesophageal non-diffuse gastric cancers in order to 1) determine the rate of EBV-associated gastric carcinomas at our institution, 2) identify any morphologic features that may allow one to identify this subset of tumors beyond the presence of lymphoid stroma (i.e. lymphoepithelial or medullary growth patterns), and 3) assess nature of PD-L1 staining in these cases.

This is a confusing point for clinicians (who operate under the assumption that all MSI-H tumors behave in a ?low grade? manner) when they receive a pathology report with a high grade MSI-H tumor.  While it is clear that tumors should be both tested for microsatellite instability and graded, further investigation is needed to determine the effect of grade on outcome in patients with MSI-H tumors.
We aim to review the slides (2 slides each) and clinical data from the cohort of 177 CRC patients who have MMR IHC, MSI-H and molecular sequencing data to determine if there is a difference in outcome between low and high grade MSI-H tumors.  We will account for CRC subtypes by dividing the carcinomas into their morphologic subtype for analysis: 1) adenocarcinoma ? intestinal type, 2) mucinous, 3) medullary and 4) signet-ring-cell carcinomas.  We will also delineate clear parameters for grade of each of the former two subtypes (intestinal and mucinous) using both the WHO recommendation for grading (i.e. >50% glandular morphology is low grade in intestinal-type adenocarcinomas) and our own criteria for mucinous adenocarcinomas since grading of mucinous adenocarcinomas is currently dependent on microsatellite status and not histology.
It is generally thought that lack of differentiation (i.e. higher grade) of a tumor plays a role in its prognosis.  As such, our hypothesis is that patients with high grade MSI-H tumors have a worse prognosis than those MSI-H tumors with low grade morphology.",8,"mej9041","",0,22-AUG-17,"",,3,"mej9041@med.cornell.edu","Rhonda Yantiss","MJ",1,"",0,,,,,""

Our review showed that of the 813 cases tested by dual methodologies, concordant results were seen in 810 cases, i.e. a concordance rate of 99.63%.  Only three discordant cases were found.  Two cases were determined as microsatellite stable (MSS) by DNA-PCR, but one showed MLH1+PMS2 loss, and the other showed loss of MSH6 only. On the other hand, one case was interpreted as MSI-H by DNA-PCR, but MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 were all read as preserved by IHC.

The high concordance rate led us to conclude that dual testing is not justified. IHC assay is less expensive, has a faster turnaround, and most importantly, can identify the specific culprit gene (e.g. MLH1) for further genetic analysis, making it the preferred method over DNA-PCR assay.  Before this conclusion is made, however, we would like to repeat the DNA-PCR and IHC assays on two different blocks in the three discordant cases, as it would help clarify the reason(s) for discrepancy and possibly identify situations when dual testing might indeed be indicated.

lesions of the pancreas. The OnCORseq will interrogate the key driver genes involved in the
carcinogenesis pathway of pancreatic cancers and pancreatic cysts such as KRAS, GNAS, CDKN2A,
SMAD4, TP53, and Notch1, offering an extensive cancer gene hotspot panel that is more extensive
than the gene panel used by other groups on pancreatic cysts, as well as full-gene coverage for
many of the other targets. This can potentially capture data that would otherwise be missed, and

In cases of suspected pancreatic cancer, endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is often the preferred method of tissue acquisition for diagnosis.  However, challenges such inadequate samples, prominent desmoplasia, and low tumor cellularity exist (3).  In addition, distinguishing reactive epithelial atypia in chronic pancreatitis from PDA has been an ongoing challenge in pancreatico-biliary cytology.  Studies establishing sensitive and specific immunohistochemical (IHC) targets for PDA have gained prominence in recent years. 

IMP3, S100P, and SMAD4 are IHC targets that have all shown promise as potential PDA markers.  IMP3 regulates cell proliferation and is expressed in fetal tissue, placenta, as well as a number of neoplasms including PDA (4).  Retrospective studies have consistently reported positive IMP3 staining in PDA and negative IMP3 staining in benign pancreas, supporting IMP3 as a sensitive and specific PDA marker (4-9).  S100P is a calcium binding protein that like IMP3 is overexpressed in a number of different neoplasms including PDA.  S100P is well documented in the literature as a sensitive and specific marker for PDA in both surgical and aspirate based specimens (10).  SMAD4 is a tumor suppressor gene that negatively regulates the growth of epithelial cells.  SMAD4 has also been studied as a possible IHC marker for PDA (11,12).  Unlike IMP3 and S100P, which are expressed in non-PDA neoplasia, SMAD4 loss is relatively specific for PDA (11,13). In addition to aiding in primary PDA diagnosis, it has been hypothesized that SMAD4 loss may also help to distinguish metastatic PDA from non-pancreatic carcinoma (11).      

There is still ongoing work to develop IHC markers for PDA.  Much of the existing literature relies on core biopsy and resection specimens rather than EUS-FNA material.  Despite the fact that IMP3 appears to be one of the most sensitive and specific IHC markers for PDA, only two studies have used IMP3 on EUS-FNA material (4,7).  Additionally, much of the existing literature focuses on single IHC markers rather than IHC panels.  While a number of studies have evaluated IMP3, S100P, and SMAD4 in combination with other IHC markers (8, 14-18), there is no study evaluating all three markers together as a panel.

We aim to perform IHC staining for IMP3, S100P, and SMAD4 on 30 EUS-FNA cellblock samples of PDA as well as 10 EUS-FNA cellblock samples of benign pancreas.

Disruption of the E-cadherin complex in lobular neoplastic cells is reflected in the loss of membranous reactivity for E-cadherin. Almost all neoplastic lobular lesions are characterized by the absence of E-cadherin reactivity (2,5). In contrast, E-cadherin expression is retained in ductal carcinomas. Aberrant expression may be seen in lobular carcinomas. However, the presence of staining does not negate a diagnosis of lobular carcinoma in a lesion that fulfills histological criteria (1,3).
In the last decade, e-cadherin immunostaining has increasingly been used as a diagnostic adjunct in distinguishing between lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) and low grade ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS) in histologically problematic cases (2,3).  Resolving this differential is critical as clinical management widely differs between the two entities.

In most cases, adherence to defining histological criteria can aid in the diagnosis of classic LCIS, foregoing the need for E-cadherin immunostaining. Morphologic features that favor a diagnosis of LCIS include loss of cellular cohesion, expansion and enlargement of the lobule by neoplastic cells with small round nuclei that lack nucleoli and have scant cytoplasm. The presence of intracytoplasmic mucin also favors a diagnosis of LCIS (5,6).
We identified 100 cases from our surgical pathology files (2015-2017) in which E-cadherin immunostaining was used in histologically difficult cases to help differentiate LCIS from low grade DCIS. Our goals are to further characterize these lesions in terms of their histologic features and evaluate the need for or misuse of E-cadherin immunostaining in classic LCIS.

There is growing evidence that inflamed white adipose tissue (WAT) may be an important link between increased adiposity and malignancy. Infiltration of non-tumorous WAT by macrophages and lymphocytes has been reported among obese individuals and may create a proneoplastic microenvironment. Furthermore, with increased BMI there is adipocyte hypertrophy and death, resulting in increased chemokine production and macrophage recruitment.  

Preliminary work by our group has focused on the association between obesity and DNA damage in BRCA1/2 positive breast tissue. We have used gamma H2AX as a surrogate marker for DNA damage in benign breast tissue. Double-strand breaks (DSBs) are DNA damage lesions that can result in genomic instability and ultimately progress to cancer. 

We aim to evaluate the fallopian tube and ovarian epithelium from BRCA1/2 positive patients in order to determine if DNA damage, as measured by gamma H2AX expression, is associated with obesity. We hypothesize that the fallopian tube epithelium of BRCA1/2 carriers, which is already at elevated risk for DSBs due to the inherited germline mutation, will demonstrate elevated levels of DNA damage in obese compared to normal weight patients. 

This is a retrospective study using tissue available from Surgical Pathology. We will use surgical specimens from patients who have a BRCA1/2 mutation and have undergone removal of the fallopian tubes and ovaries at New York Presbyterian Hospital.

This is a confusing point for clinicians (who operate under the assumption that all MSI-H tumors behave in a ?low grade? manner) when they receive a pathology report with a high grade MSI-H tumor.

The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of EBV-specific autologous T cells (CMD-003- the study drug) in the treatment of EBV+ DLBCL, HL and PTLD after failing first-line treatment. CMD-003 is a formulation of patient derived, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antigen stimulated and expanded T lymphocytes for the treatment of EBV positive malignancies.
EBV may be associated with several different types of lymphomas, including Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), Hodgkin?s Lymphoma (HL), NKT cell lymphoma and Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). Rates of EBV positivity in these different tumors range from 5-10% for DLBCL to virtually 100% for NKT lymphoma.
Each patient will be monitored for safety and efficacy for 1 year after the first CMD-003 dose administration. This study is expected to complete patient enrollment in 24 months, for a total study duration of 3 years from the first patient in to the last patient study visit. Long-term survival information will be collected for an additional 12 months following the Final Study Visit.
This is an open label, Phase 2 multicenter trial. Up to 70 patients with 3 types of EBV positive tumors will be enrolled and treated with autologous EBV-specific T cell infusion (CMD-003).",5,"lymphoma","Admin approved - BH 9/5/17",1,03-SEP-17,"Unstained slides from paraffin-embedded tissue: $10 x 20 slides x 5 cases = $1000

Molecular changes in that transition are not well characterized.
In addition, there is a possibility that the transition occurs PRIOR to morphologic acquisition of invasion. In that scenario, the changes will be most dramatic between AIS and LPA but not within LPA.
A pilot project is proposed in which a group of AIS is compared to the proposed insitu component of the LPA, which is compared to the invasive component of the same LPA. This will require careful case selection and microdissection. The proposal is to dissect cellular areas of 10 AIS lesion and 10 LPA (10 insitu component and 10 invasive component).

Moreover, NEAT1 was associated with therapeutic resistance, being upregulated in castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Finally, in multivariate analysis, NEAT1 expression was associated with biochemical recurrence, metastasis, prostate cancer specific mortality and Gleason >7.

Although the majority
of SMZL displays an indolent course, the disease is still incurable. Also, a significant proportion of patients (~25-30%) experience a poor outcome and survive <5 years. The accurate identification of high risk cases represents an unmet medical need in SMZL and can help future clinical trial design and rationale and cost-effective development of treatments based on novel agents. Indeed, the efforts of clinical research should focus on novel drugs and combinations for those cases who have high risk disease and an expected survival of few years when treated with conventional approaches. Currently, the prognosis of SMZL can be stratified on the clinical ground by two scores, namely the IIL and the HPLL scores, though they are neither 100% sensitive nor 100% specific in the identification of high risk patients. Because molecular aspects of SMZL (i.e. immunoglobulin gene mutations, 7q deletion, and NOTCH2, KLF2 and TP53 mutations) represent promising prognostic biomarkers, their incorporation into the current available clinical prognostic models for SMZL might improve risk stratification of patients. This is a multicenter study involving 44 centers in Europe and the US. The goal is to accrue at least 300 patient samples.

No specific diagnostic marker exists and current panels of immunostains, which require greater cellularity, cannot definitively distinguish benign reactive and malignant mesothelial cells. 

The tumor suppressor BRCA Associated Protein 1 (BAP1) is newly appreciated to distinguish MM from benign mesothelial cells based on its pattern of intracellular localization. BAP1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) has been shown to be of diagnostic value in surgical biopsy specimens as well as cellblock (CB) preparations of effusion samples.  

In addition, FISH shows homozygous deletion of p16 in malignant compared to benign mesothelial processes.

A recent study has shown BAP1 IHC and p16 FISH to be helpful in diagnosing mesotheliomas on effusion cytology samples with a proposed scheme using these two markers to definitively evaluate mesothelioma in scanty samples.  More studies, however, are required to help definitively evaluate this concept. 

Here we propose studying BAP1 staining and p16 deletion on a series of cell blocks prepared from both fine needle aspiration biopsy and effusion samples of mesothelioma cases.

that doses of 150 and 300 mg FT-2102 once daily (QD) will be tested.
On the initial schedule (Schedule 1), FT-2102 will be given orally QD in continuous
28-day cycles. An alternative schedule (Schedule 2) of FT-2102 administered orally twice
daily (BID) may be initiated based upon observed PK and clinical observations.
This study will utilize a 3+3 dose escalation design, whereby three patients will be treated
and if a DLT occurs, then the cohort will be expanded to six patients to determine a
nontolerated dose and MTD. The dose-escalation portion of the study will allow dose
increases of up to 50% between cohorts above the 300 mg total daily dose level until the
MTD is determined. Initiation of Schedule 2 will occur following analysis of PK/PD

In recent years, this test has become increasingly popular for oncologists and was ordered for over 150 breast cancer patients at Weill Cornell in 2016. 
	In addition to providing a recurrence score, Oncotype DX reports information on the levels of expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER-2, as well as a ?positive/negative? results. In some institutions, these latter results are used as the final determinant of hormone receptor status, or may serve as a ?tiebreaker? for HER2 status in equivocal cases. Not infrequently, OncotypeDX ER/PR/HER2 results are discordant from immunohistochemical analysis of these markers, which results from a variety of factors. Discordance in these tests create management dilemmas for clinicians with regard to treatment with adjuvant endocrine therapy or anti-HER2 therapies, while also (unfortunately) resulting in a loss of confidence in the immunohistochemistry lab.
	The purpose of this study is to determine the frequency of discordance between IHC/FISH results and OncotypeDX results for ER, PR, and HER2 from invasive breast carcinomas treated at Weill Cornell and sent for Oncotype DX. For discordant cases, IHC slides will be reviewed and scored for percentage and intensity of staining (for hormone receptors) and scored according to current ASCO/CAP guidelines for HER2. We plan to correlate the levels of expression of each marker by IHC with pCR, and potentially identify cutoff points at which discordance occurs. Other data that will be reviewed and reported are: OncotypeDX recurrence score, tumor type, and tumor grade. Finally, we will study how clinicians managed patients with discordant Oncotype/IHC results. This study will span 6 years (2011-2016).
	For this study, we will require slides and blocks to be pulled for discordant cases. If necessary, IHC will be repeated on the same block that was sent for OncotypeDX, as in many cases, ER/PR/HER2 status will have been determined on the core biopsy prior to surgical excision. We estimate that approximately 25 cases will have discordance in which immunohistochemistry will need to be repeated.

Thus, differentiating CCPRCC from other subtypes has prognostic implications. Although the morphology of CCPRCC is well-established, the molecular landscape remains unknown.

First, we will confirm that the 17 sequenced cases show the expected CCPRCC immunohistochemical profile. Stained slides where available will be reviewed. If needed, CK7 and CAIX immunostains will be repeated on select cases. Second, we propose to create a tumor microarray with tumor and matched controls to assess GATA3 and PSMA in our cohort. Moreover, five tumors each of clear cell, chromophobe and papillary RCC will be included to compare their staining pattern to CCPRCC.

Classification of lung tumors and establishment of a small or large cell neuroendocrine component is important for downstream management and molecular studies. Currently, we employ cytoplasmic (Chromogranin and Synaptophysin) and/or membranous (CD56) neuroendocrine immunohistochemical markers; however, a combination of these markers can be negative in 10-25% of small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas.

Prior work has examined tumor related alteration that are associated with this progression, but there is less information regarding non-tumoral stromal alteration. As part of a collaborative project, we have used a tissue microarray of 90 adenocarcinomas with different degrees of invasion with a specialized immunofluorescence assay that can simultaneously assay multiple antigens. Several observations came out of that analysis, but these conclusions were at the extremes of the phenotypic changes ? pure in situ and overt invasion. However the cases which are radiologically part solid, with both lepidic and invasive patterns, were more difficult to characterize. One concern is that the tissue microarray did not entirely capture the heterogeneity within the tumor, including changes at the invasive edge.
To address this issue, we propose to examine a subset of the cases on whole slides rather than tissue microarray. There were four observations to follow-up. The first, the distribution of granzyme B positive subset of CD8 cells may be of interest in the two regions. The second, the presence of increased numbers of SMA positive stromal cells in the interstitium. The third involved morphologic changes in the tumor cells, likely attributed to intercellular tumor adhesion and tumor to stromal adhesion. Finally, the Ki67, as a measure of tumor cell cycle activity, was thought to be an important factor in understanding the impact of the potential impact of the stromal environment?s effect on the tumor. Specifically, that the invasive component gains the ability to outstrip cytotoxic cellular effects through increased cell division.

However, the role of mycobiota during immunosuppression has not been explored yet. This is partially due to lack of standardized approaches, databases and experimental models to support the mycobiome studies. Immunosuppression therapy is a standard-of-care for many patients with autoimmune and chronic inflammatory conditions including Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). These patient populations are frequently receiving immunomodulatory therapy and provide a pool of individuals, where gut mycobiota can be investigated under such conditions. Our preliminary studies identified fungal taxa associated with Ulcerative Colitis (a form of IBD) and specific opportunistic fungi (including Candida albicans and Aspergillus sydowii) that expand in patients treated with immunosuppressive drugs.

Thus, our lab seeks to elucidate how immune cells contribute to glioma progression or malignant transformation of low-grade (LGG) to high-grade glioma (HGG). 

Work in our lab and others has shown that MDSCs are recruited to gliomas, and that there is a relative increase in their numbers in HGGs compared to LGGs and that these cells are required for tumor progression. In this aim, we will further characterize the MDSC populations during tumor progression with a particular interest in determining the ratio of monocytes and neutrophils populations in the blood and tumor during glioma progression.

HER2 is a transmembrane tyrosine-protein kinase and a member of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER/EGFR/ERBB) family.  HER2 overexpression is associated with higher recurrence rates and increased mortalities (1-4). Overexpression of the HER2 may be evaluated via the immunohistochemical (IHC) membranous staining pattern. At our institution, in cases of equivocal IHC staining, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for proto-oncogene ERBB2 amplification is performed. Regardless of methodology utilized, HER2+ cases are eligible for anti-HER2 therapy. Use of HER2 targeted therapy is increasingly prevalent, accounting for 20-30% of breast cancers (5). There is evidence that anti-HER2 therapy is more effective in patients with HER2+ by IHC than HER2+ by FISH (6-8). Recently, we found that HER2 positive tumors by IHC had better response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy than HER2 FISH positive, IHC negative or equivocal cases. Thus, more robust techniques are desired for quantifying HER2 protein expression in carcinoma cells. 
	In 2014, Giesen et al. coupled immunohistochemical methods with high-resolution laser ablation to CyTOF mass cytometry. Using rare earth metal reporters on antibodies, they were able to determine biomarker expression on human breast cancer samples, including HER2 (9). Recently, immunocytochemistry was combined with laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry on single eukaryotic cells (10). The successful application of this well-understood methodology on tumor cells provides a tremendous opportunity for translational researchers. Mass cytometry may allow for more accurate biomarker quantification than current techniques and provide the attending pathologist additional information that can factor into their signout.  
	In this study, we will be using commercially available control slides of HER2 overexpressing tissue and HER2 negative tissue. Using immunohistochemistry coupled with laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, we will quantify HER2 protein expression on positive and negative controls.",5,"pjm9005","Admin approved - BH 11/9/17",1,07-NOV-17,"Budget:

CCM may occur sporadically or as a familial syndrome with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with variable expression and incomplete penetrance. Mutations in three genes, KRIT1 (also known as CCM1), CCM2, and PDCD10 (also known as CCM3), cause the majority of familial cerebral cavernous malformations. However, mutations in the KRIT1, CCM2, and PDCD10 genes are not involved in sporadic cerebral cavernous malformations. The cause of this form of the condition is unknown.
Studies of non-cerebral venous malformations in mice and human subjects found that the majority contain hotspot mutations in the oncogenes TEK or PIK3CA. Importantly, VM was successfully treated in mouse models using pharmacological inhibitors of the PIK3CA pathway, indicating that these genes may hold important treatment implications in humans, especially in sites where surgery may not be an option, such as the brain.
Our study aims to serve as a pilot investigation to characterize the mutational profile of sporadic cerebral vascular malformations.

In 10 selected radical prostatectomy cases wherein IDC-P represents >20% of the index tumor area, areas of IDC-P and associated high-grade invasive carcinoma will be obtained (via 1 mm punches from FFPE tissue blocks) for molecular analysis. DNA and RNA will be extracted from these tissue cores and sent for analysis by the commercially-available OncoScan CNV Assay and the Clariom D microarray assay, respectively.  Comparison of the alterations seen in invasive and IDC-P will be performed, as well as a comparison to TCGA data from organ-confined and castrate-resistant prostate cancers.",5,"fkhani1","Admin approved - BH 2/21/18",1,16-FEB-18,"Nucleic acid extraction (30 paraffin cores x $30 for DNA x $30 for RNA) = $1800

The purpose of this study is to evaluate MCL-1 protein expression in a breast cancer, evaluate differences in expression between breast cancer subtypes and correlate protein expression in breast cancer cases with known MCL1 gene amplification. Finally, we will evaluate whether any of these findings correlate with other prognostic factors and survival. Our aims are:

1.	Analyze immunohistochemical expression of MCL-1 in human breast cancer on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues.
2.	Compare MCL-1 protein expression by immunohistochemistry in a cohort of 30 cases of TNBC with known MCL1 gene status (10 amplified, 20 non-mutated).
3.	Correlate MCL-1 protein expression in breast cancer with clinicopathologic parameters, including age, tumor size, nodal involvement, tumor grade, biomarker status, and, if possible, patient outcomes.

For aim 1, we will perform MCL-1 immunohistochemistry on previously constructed tissue microarrays (TMAs) composed of breast cancer samples. We will evaluate expression of these proteins in breast cancer cells. In total, we expect to use nine TMAs and estimate that 2000 cases will be analyzed.

The markers include chromogranin and synaptophysin (cytoplasmic) and/or CD56 (membranous). However, in some cases of NET there is lack of expression of one or more NE markers. Some of these markers also lack specificity in distinguishing solid pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPN) and acinar cell carcinoma (ACC) from NET. Rooper et al. and Doxtader et al. recently demonstrated a novel nuclear neuroendocrine marker, insulinoma-associated protein 1 (INSM1), to have superior sensitivity and specificity to the combined NE panel in lung biopsies and cytology specimens. Tanigawa et al. demonstrated similar findings in surgically excised pancreatic tumors. However, the role of INSM1 IHC on limited sample from pancreas cytology is largely unknown. We will perform INSM1 IHC on cellblock (CB) material with diagnoses of NET, SPN, ACC and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA).  Using the antibody clone that we have optimized in the TRP, we will assess INSM1 in 30 NET CB samples and in ~ 5 CB/surgical samples (whichever available) of SPN and ACC and 15 CB of PDA (controls). We expect diffuse nuclear INSM1 staining in NET and where available will compare our findings with prior CD56, synaptophysin and chromogranin IHC.

WES demonstrated clustered mutations with APOBEC mutation signature adjacent to a focal deletion in ARID1A gene. ARID1A is postulated to be a tumor suppressor as a chromatin modifying gene in the SWI/SNF complex. Approximately 50% of ovarian CCC has been reported to harbor mutations in this gene. ARID1A gene was depicted as the most significantly mutated gene in urothelial carcinomas by TCGA. Usually, ARID1A mutations in urothelial carcinoma are truncating mutations due to indels. In our case, it is uncertain whether the upstream deletion and subsequent missense mutations would lead to a truncating protein and loss of function (or antigenicity), respectively. Using IHC, we attempt to investigate the effect of genetic alterations in ARID1A. We are using 5 antibodies targeting ARID1A and associated proteins in the SWI/SNF complex.

A high-throughput in vitro screen of 114 compounds tested against patient-derived DIPG cells facilitated selection of four drugs (enzalutamide: androgen receptor inhibitor, tamoxifen citrate: selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), fulvestrant: selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD), and anastrazole: aromatase inhibitor) commonly used in the treatment of breast and prostate cancers with potential bioactivity in DIPG cells.

Using publically available, retrospective gene expression data (n=51), we identified a subset of DIPG tumors with high expression of CYP19A1 and AR. Kaplan-Meier plots were then generated to compare the survival of those with high vs. low expression of the target genes. Above median AR expression in DIPG tumors correlated significantly to poorer prognosis to survival (p=0.02821, log-rank test statistic = 4.815).

Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) are lethal forms of the disease, with reported differences in their clinical and molecular characteristics [2]. We have previously reported on an inverse transcriptional pattern of prothrombin/thrombin (F2) and tissue factor (F3) in NEPC (higher F2, lower F3) compared with mCRPC (lower F2, higher F3) [3]. However the clinical implications of these biological differences are poorly understood. In addition, our ability to predict VTE in cancer patients with the use of Khorana score has limitations, and improved risk stratification methods are needed to implement an effective prophylactic strategy [4].

Subjects with the diagnosis of mCRPC or NEPC that have pathology available for review will be identified retrospectively.  Available tissues in samples from mCRPC and NEPC patients will then be assessed for expression of F2 and F3. 

Assessing the IHC expression of F2, F3 and a) clinical thrombotic events; b) prediction thereof with use of Khorana score, in mCRPC and NEPC patients is expected to expand our understanding on the clinical significance of differential expression of F2 and F3 in mCRPC and NEPC patients. This is a step further to  potential use of these coagulation factors as predictors of thrombotic events or/and prognosticators of cancer outcomes. Moreover, the results of this study may support implementing prophylactic anticoagulation in such patient populations or even F2, F3 targeting approaches  in mCRPC or/and NEPC, given the biological association of hemostasis with tumor growth, progression, and metastasis [5, 6].

This drug has been used in other research studies, and information from these studies suggests that BBI-608 may be a potential treatment for colorectal cancers. 
 
The purpose of this study is to find out whether it is better to receive standard treatment with FOLFIRI, a chemotherapy combination treatment made up of anti-cancer drugs 5-fluoropyrimidine, leucovorin and irinotecan, or if it is better to receive standard agent  FOLFIRI in combination with the investigational drug, BBI-608 for the treatment of colorectal cancer. To do this, half of the patients in this study will receive FOLFIRI in combination with the investigational agent BBI-608 and the other half will receive FOLFIRI only. In addition to study treatment with FOLFIRI, you and your study doctor will decide if you should receive additional standard chemotherapy, bevacizumab. If your doctor decides that administration of bevacizumab is an appropriate treatment for you, bevacizumab will be administered together with FOLFIRI beginning with the first FOLFIRI treatment with or without BBI-608. 

You and your doctor will decide if addition of bevacizumab is in your best interest. Please talk to your study doctor or usual cancer doctor (if different from the study doctor) about the details of bevacizumab treatment as well as the known benefits and risks of bevacizumab before you decide if you want to take part in this study.

The purpose of this study is to see if daratumumab when given with three other drugs [cyclophosphamide, bortezomib (VELCADE®) and dexamethasone] is useful for treating patients with AL Amyloidosis. 
The study will look at what happens when daratumumab is given with these three drugs compared to just giving those three drugs alone.  The safety of daratumumab when given with cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (CyBorD) will also be studied.  Daratumumab is an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody that binds to CD38, which is a protein that?s expressed on multiple myeloma plasma cells. Daratumumab has FDA approval for patients with multiple myeloma, however it is not yet approved for patients with AL amyloidosis. CyBorD is a chemotherapy combination made of three different drugs that is approved for treating Multiple Myeloma.  In clinical trials, CyBorD has shown promise in improving the care for patients with AL amyloidosis.  CyBorD is not approved by any regulatory authority for the treatment of AL amyloidosis.

Of the IHC equivocal cases, 4% will also be equivocal by FISH testing.(3) Therefore, an alternative test which can deliver accurate and reliable results would be of great clinical utility. 

Digital PCR (dPCR) is a recent methodology for absolute nucleic acid quantification.(4) The technique can be developed for high throughput, applied to formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue (FFPE), and has the power for multiplex analysis.(4) A few recent studies have compared dPCR with standard HER2 testing methodology on formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue and the results have been promising.(5-8) These studies have shown 79.3% to 100% sensitivity and 88.5% to 100% specificity of dPCR compared to IHC and FISH results.(6-8) Additionally, in contrast to conventional FISH test, dPCR allows interrogation of multiple regions on chromosome 17 as the reference gene for HER2 quantification. Given this advantage, dPCR may be a better choice to detect HER2 copy number changes in cases with polysomy, which are frequently show equivocal HER2 FISH results.

In the era of genomic characterization, little is known about AME tumors and in particular, their metastatic counterparts.  The aim of this study was to provide insight into the molecular underpinnings of a spectrum of AME tumors. 

Design: Five cases of AME tumors of the breast (benign-1, atypical-1, in situ-1, invasive-1, invasive with paired axillary lymph node metastasis-1) were identified in our files. The six samples were interrogated using the Oncomine Comprehensive Assay v3 at CGIX. 

Results:  The atypical and AME in situ cases harbored the same gain-of -function PIK3CA mutation. The malignant AME in situ also showed EGFR amplification. Both benign and invasive AME (case without metastasis) shared the same gain-of-function AKT1 variant. Moreover, the same gain-of-function HRAS mutation was present in the atypical AME and invasive AME with metastasis. No fusion drivers were detected. 

Conclusion: We describe the molecular characteristics of the spectrum of AME tumors of the breast, which harbor alterations in PI3K/AKT pathway. Our findings are clinically relevant given the current options of targeted therapy in rare instances where malignant AME tumors of the breast progress.

Some of these markers also lack specificity in distinguishing solid pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPN) and acinar cell carcinoma (ACC) from NET. Rooper et al. and Doxtader et al. recently demonstrated a novel nuclear neuroendocrine marker, insulinoma-associated protein 1 (INSM1), to have superior sensitivity and specificity to the combined NE panel in lung biopsies and cytology specimens. Tanigawa et al. demonstrated similar findings in surgically excised pancreatic tumors. However, the role of INSM1 IHC on limited sample from pancreas cytology is largely unknown. We will perform INSM1 IHC on cellblock (CB) material with diagnoses of NET, SPN, ACC and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA).

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDA) tends to have lower to variable mutational burden and therefore only 4-49% of PDA are PD-L1 positive (4). Some studies have shown that PDA with PD-L1 positivity on immunostaining has poorer prognosis than PD-L1 negative tumors (5, 6). PD-L1 expression has also seemed to correlate inversely with CD8 + tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), thus suggesting that like its lung and renal counterparts, the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway may be a critical regulator in human pancreatic cancer (4).  PD-L1 inhibition has shown to effectively reduce pancreatic cancer in mouse models through its role in increasing IFN-ã and IL-10 production (8). Such outcomes have prompted targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway as a therapeutic option for PDA. 

Despite this evidence, there has been a variable response to PD-L1 inhibitor therapy shown in a few studies on a handful of PDA patients (9-11,14). This could most likely be explained by very few pancreatic cancer patients enrolled in the studies, the overall lower than average rate of PD-L1 positivity in PDA, and lack of a defined uniform cut off for PD-L1 expression in PDA for appropriate patient selection (8). 

PD-L1 testing by immunohistochemistry (IHC) is being increasingly requested on PDA samples by oncologists and is being performed on surgical samples. A recent study explored the prevalence of PD-L1 expression in PDA using IHC on surgical resection and correlated the findings with clinical characteristics, MMR status and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. The study showed that overall there was an inverse relationship between PD-L1 expression and disease survival in resected PDA. Therefore, PD-L1 blockage may be an effective therapeutic option in certain groups (6). 

While PD-L1 (IHC) is approved for formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) surgical specimens, PD-L1 testing on cellblock specimens is being evaluated. Studies have shown good concordance between cytologic and histologic specimens and have demonstrated cytology cellblocks to be viable options to perform testing (13). One study showed that ninety-two percent of cellblocks had an adequate number of tumor cells, consistent with that of small biopsies. Overall, this study, along with others, demonstrated that PD-L1 immunohistochemistry is feasible on cellblocks (12).

A majority of studies examining PD-L1 testing on cellblocks have evaluated non small-cell lung cancer or other solid tumor types. At this time, there is no data to support PD-L1 testing on cellblock specimens from PDA despite the fact that cytology specimens often represent the entirety of diagnostic material for these patients. We aim to perform PD-L1 IHC on approximately 100 cellblock samples of PDA from endoscopic ultrasound guided-FNA and correlate PD-L1 expression with clinical outcome, using the DAKO M365329-1 (22C3) clone, validating them separately on cytolyt (methanol) fixed and formalin fixed cell blocks.",1,"vic9089","",0,04-AUG-18,"",,2,"rer9052@med.cornell.edu","Rema Rao","RR",0,"",,,,,,""

ACLF is the most life-threatening complication of cirrhosis and occurs in 31% of cirrhotic patients who experience decompensation [2].  Despite its clinical relevance as a life-threatening complication of chronic liver disease, the pathophysiology and histology of this entity remains poorly described [3].  
	ACLF likely represents a dysregulated inflammatory response to an inciting event in patients with pre-existing chronic liver disease.  This dysregulated inflammatory response is systemic and presents clinically in patients with ACLF as SIRS.  The immune response in ACLF is characterized by abnormal elevation in pro-inflammatory cytokines, circulating white blood cells, and c-reactive peptide, as well as the simultaneous inhibition of normal monocyte function [3] [4] [5] [6].   The association between a dysregulated inflammatory response and ACLF is independent of the inciting event etiology and appears to be a defining feature of ACLF [1] [3].  It has been hypothesized that exaggerated systemic inflammation in ACLF may stem from pre-existing hepatic reticuloendothelial system dysfunction.  It has also been postulated that monocyte dysfunction in ACLF might represent a regulatory response to exaggerated pro-inflammatory signaling.  The precise mechanisms that govern inflammation in ACLF, however, remain unknown. 
	Histologic description of ACLF in the literature is limited.  Katoonizadeh et. al. reported that ductular bilirubinostasis, cholangiolitis, and Mallory bodies were more prevalent on liver biopsy in patients with ACLF compared to patients with decompensated liver disease [7].  In their study comparing ACLF and acute decompensated cirrhosis in patients with hepatitis B, Li et. al. found that sub-massive hepatic necrosis was associated with ACLF and was a key distinguishing feature between these two related but distinct entities [8].  Rastogi et. al. found that amongst patients with ACLF, the presence of bile ductular cholestasis, fibrosis, and parenchymal necrosis was associated with higher mortality.  They also reported that, with the exception of associations between mallory?s hyaline, pericellular fibrosis and acute alcoholic hepatitis, there were no correlations between liver biopsy histology and inciting event etiology [9].  Of note, these studies used the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver criteria for ACLF rather than the more recent World Congress of Gastroenterology consensus criteria.  Additionally, no attempt has been made to describe the immune profile of hepatic inflammatory infiltrates in ACLF.  The characterization of hepatic immune cell phenotypes in ACLF will be a key step towards understanding this immune mediated disease.",5,"Jas9275","Admin approved - BH 7/20/18

In order to gain more insight into the biological underpinnings of prostate cancer brain metastases, a comprehensive molecular characterization utilizing whole genome sequencing and a custom in-house Nanostring assay is currently underway on a series of surgically resected prostate cancer brain metastases at Weill Cornell (including both dural and true parenchymal lesions).

The incidence of CD varies across different geographic regions, likely reflecting a multifactorial etiology where both genetic and environmental factors contribute to disease pathogenesis, and has an estimated prevalence of 200 per 100000 in North America.  The terminal ileum and colon are both involved by disease in approximately 50% of patients, while a smaller proportion of patients have isolated ileal or colonic disease.

While appendectomy for acute appendicitis has been shown to be associated with a lower incidence of ulcerative colitis, for unclear reasons this population paradoxically has a higher incidence of CD.  Some authors speculate that this may be due to appendiceal involvement by CD presenting clinically as acute appendicitis.  Pathologic features of inflammatory bowel disease may also be overlooked in appendectomy specimens leading to misdiagnosis.

Conversely, granulomatous inflammation is seen in a small minority of appendectomy specimens.  Although granulomas can be attributed to an infectious cause, sarcoidosis, or reaction to foreign material in most instances, granulomatous inflammation of the appendix, either in isolation or as a component of more widespread disease, has also been reported in patients with CD.  One report suggests granulomatous inflammation of the appendix in appendectomy specimens represented involvement of the organ by CD in up to 10% of cases.

While there have been attempts to distinguish granulomatous appendicitis from CD involving the appendix, there are no established criteria and the current dogma causes many pathologists will invoke the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease when granulomas are identified in appendectomy specimens.  We do not believe that this is the case and, in our practice, rarely find evidence of disease in the appendix in right hemicolectomy and ileocolectomy specimens for CD.  We have identified a study group of 300 surgical resections for CD that include the appendix with clinical follow-up and hypothesize that involvement of the appendix is exceedingly rare.

Driver mutations in JAK2, MPL and CALR have been identified, although approximately 12% of cases are negative for mutations in these genes. In addition, similar mutations may result in clinically and morphologically distinct myeloproliferative disorders. How these differences are regulated is of both scientific and clinical relevance. Interestingly, CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors from PMF patients demonstrate a distinct gene expression profile with the Rho GTPase, CDC42, being one of the most differentially down-regulated genes (Blood 2014; 124:e21). In addition, CDC42 has been shown to regulate hematopoietic stem cell function with CDC42-deficient mice developing a fatal myeloproliferative disorder (Blood 2007; 110:3853).
