SCP and SFTP both are secured based on SSH

Use SFTP - control of the remote file system

Steps:
1) On the master server, when antibody is updated, add the antibody's ID to the table 'TransferData':
Entity Info - $entityId, $className. $entityId - antibody ID
InterfaceTransferList ID
Status - transfer status (use TransferStatusList)
Create Date
Update Date
Creator

2) Cron job get TransferData and generate the JSON file transfer-data.json with antibodies data to transfer

3) This file transfer-data.json is transferred to the remote server

4) Remote server process this transfer-data.json and create/update/delete antibodies

5) After processing on the remote server, the remote server create the list
of the successfully processed antibodies IDs (via the same TransferData or as a JSON file)

6) The master server will get the list of successfully processed antibodies IDs
from remote server and update the status of the records in the TransferData table.

TODO:
1) Add secret key to the site settings
2) Add some variable on the server to indicate that this server is a master and will transfer data to other server
3) Add Original ID (oid) to match the unique transferable entity between source and destination servers? (done - sourceId)

TODO:
test baseurl if no port provided (done)
update view servers with DB and composer (done)
