Roles does not have GlobalFellowshipSpecialty => only roles with FellowshipSubspecialty will be found => will not work for GlobalFellowshipSpecialty

GlobalFellowshipSpecialty:
Find associated roles for GlobalFellowshipSpecialty similar to createOrEnableFellAppRole()
//create Director role
$roleName = "ROLE_FELLAPP_".$roleType."_".$roleNameBase;
//echo "1 roleName=$roleName<br>";
$role = $em->getRepository(Roles::class)->findOneByName($roleName);

TODO: rewrite getRolesByFellowshipSubspecialtyAndRolename used by fellapp_fellowshiptype_setting_edit

$fellappUtil->processRemovedUsersByFellowshipSetting($felltype, $felltype->getDirectors(), $origDirectors, "_DIRECTOR_");
processRemovedUsersByFellowshipSetting -> removeRoleFromUsers -> getRoleByFellowshipSubspecialtyAndRolename -> getRolesByFellowshipSubspecialtyAndRolename

GlobalFellowshipSpecialty and FellowshipSubspecialty have institution which is used instead of _WCM_
Role can have an institution too, but it's not used
User has Role. Role is linked to fellowship specialty by upper case role name BLOODBANKINGANDTRANSFUSIONMEDICINE.
Role ROLE_FELLAPP_DIRECTOR_BLOODBANKINGANDTRANSFUSIONMEDICINE is used by both users WCM and WASHU
How to find roles such as DIRECTOR, COORDINATOR, INTERVIEWER associated to the user?
How to remove or assign role to the user (processRemovedUsersByFellowshipSetting, assignFellAppAccessRoles)?
$fellappUtil->processRemovedUsersByFellowshipSetting($felltype, $felltype->getDirectors(), $origDirectors, "_DIRECTOR_");
Do we need to have two roles for each institution in case of apply server where multiple institution can be used on apply page?
It's ok on apply page, but it will not work for configuration - the same director will appear on WCM and WashU
THEREFORE: ADD WCM or WASHU to the role name

Below will not a solution to get users by role name:
if( GlobalFellowshipSpecialty ) {

    //role=ROLE_FELLAPP_DIRECTOR_WCM_BLOODBANKINGANDTRANSFUSIONMEDICINE
    //$roleType: DIRECTOR
    //$roleNameBase: WCM or WashU (GlobalFellowshipSpecialty institution abbreviation)
    $roleName = "ROLE_FELLAPP_".$roleType."_".$roleNameBase; //ROLE_FELLAPP_DIRECTOR_BLOODBANKINGANDTRANSFUSIONMEDICINE
    $role = $em->getRepository(Roles::class)->findOneByName($roleName);

} else {

    $repository = $this->em->getRepository(Roles::class);
    $dql = $repository->createQueryBuilder("list");
    $dql->select('list');
    $dql->where("list.name LIKE :name1 AND list.name LIKE :name2");

    $parameters = array(
        "name1" => '%' . $partialRoleName . '%',
        "name2" => '%' . $fellowshipSubspecialtyName . '%'
    );

    $query = $dql->getQuery();
    $query->setParameters($parameters);

    $roles = $query->getResult();

}
