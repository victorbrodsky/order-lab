How to create new fellapp specialty:
1) Find or Create FellowshipSubspecialty with name (i.e. Cytopathology)
2) Add to this FellowshipSubspecialty institution 'WCM->Pathology'
3) Go to https://view.online/c/test-institution/test-department/fellowship-applications/fellowship-types-settings
4) Now Cytopathology is showing as a new fellowship specialty -> click Cytopathology
5) Add coordinators, directors, interviewers
6) Click Update
7) Error because ROLE_FELLAPP_COORDINATOR_WCM_CYTOPATHOLOGY does not have Fellowship Subspecialty

Solution:
1) Generate roles without specific fellapp role (i.e. ROLE_FELLAPP_DIRECTOR_WCM_CYTOPATHOLOGY)

site settings -> /create-default-fellowship-type -> createDefaultFellowshipTypes
1) Create FellowshipSubspecialty
2) link subspecialty with institution
3) create a new role (if not existed)
4) add administrators
5) ? ERROR in $this->assignFellAppAccessRoles($subspecialtyType,$subspecialtyType->getDirectors(),"DIRECTOR");

/add-fellowship-application-type
Check where setFellowshipSubspecialty is used
use createOrEnableFellAppRole in generateAllFellowshipSubspecialties?

Changes - don't use institution (or institution is optional) in fellowship subspecialty:
replace getFellowshipTypesByInstitution by getValidFellowshipTypes

Role-Permission

Role -> Permission -> PermissionList (Create a New Fellowship Application) -> PermissionObjectList (FellowshipApplication), PermissionActionList (create)
