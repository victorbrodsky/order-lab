Partial Invoice:
“Requested Quantity”, “Completed Quantity”, “Previously Invoiced Quantity” (not editable), and “Orderable Status”

The values for the “Requested Quantity” and “Completed Quantity”
should come from the corresponding parent Work Request fields for each invoice row.

The value in the “Previously Invoiced Quantity” should come from the total of
all quantities for this item code in all existing invoices with non-”Canceled” status
of the same parent work request.

The value of the “Orderable Status” drop down menu should come from the parent work request for this orderable line item.

Get and show these fields from Request.

Take only completed quantity for now.
