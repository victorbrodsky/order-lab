#Create a new branch
#Maybe use Custom Routing, Listnere, or look at Dynamic Router, ChainRouter (Symfony Content Management Framework (CMF))
#Maybe use Listener to switch DBs and URLs
#Reorganise the yml config files to adopt to /c/ entry point for all bundles.

Goal:
1) Separate DBs (preferable)
view.online/c/wcm/pathology - use DB_wcm
view.online/c/hss/pathology - use DB_hss

2) Single DB: wcm and hss use the sam DB but all entities/tables will have a new Hosted User Group ID
Disadvantage: lots of changes to update CRUD logic, difficult separation of the records between wcm and hss
